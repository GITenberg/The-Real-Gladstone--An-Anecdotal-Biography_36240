<p>In this little work I have aimed to write, not a history or a
biography, not a criticism or a eulogy, but merely to give a few
scattered notes, gathered from many quarters, for the general
public, rather than for the professional politician.&nbsp; Lord
Rosebery is reported to have said that it will require many
writers to give a complete biography of Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; He
may be right; but the evil of it will be, the work, if
exhaustive, will be exhausting.&nbsp; Especially will it be so in
these busy times, when yesterday&rsquo;s biographies become stale
to a public forgetful of the past, caring only for the present,
oblivious of the morrow.&nbsp; It is almost an impertinence to
speak of the many claims Mr. Gladstone has on a people whom he
has served so long.&nbsp; All I claim to do is to give a few data
which may help them to estimate the</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BIRTH AND SCHOOLDAYS.</span></h2>
<p>Many, many years ago England&rsquo;s foremost statesman, as
George Canning then was, distrusted by the multitude, feared by
his colleagues, regarded with suspicion by the First Gentleman of
the Age&mdash;as it was the fashion to term George the
Magnificent, who was then seated on the British
throne&mdash;wearied of the strife and turmoil of party, spent a
short time at Seaforth House, bidding what he deemed his farewell
to his Liverpool correspondents.&nbsp; His custom, we are told,
was to sit for hours gazing on the wide expanse of waters before
him.&nbsp; His had been a marvellous career.&nbsp; Born out of
the circle of the ruling classes, by his indomitable energy, the
greatness of his intellectual gifts, his brilliant eloquence, he
had lifted himself up above his contemporaries, and had become
their leader; and here he was about to quit the scene of his
triumphs&mdash;to reign as Viceroy in a far-off land.&nbsp;
Canning, however, did not retire from the Parliamentary arena,
but stopped at <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>home to be Premier of Great Britain and Ireland, and to
let all Europe know that this country had done with the Holy
Alliance; that a new and better spirit was walking the earth;
that the dark night of bigotry was past, and that the dawn of a
better day had come.&nbsp; As he sat there looking out over the
waters, a little one was to be seen playing below upon the
sand.&nbsp; That little lad was the son of Canning&rsquo;s host
and friend, and his name was William Ewart Gladstone.&nbsp; Does
it not seem as if the little one playing on the sand had
unconsciously caught something of the genius, of the
individuality, of the eloquence, of the loftiness of aim, of the
statesman who sat above him overlooking the sea?&nbsp;
Circumstances have much to do with the formation of
character.&nbsp; To the youthful Gladstone, Canning was a light,
a glory, and a star.</p>
<p>William Ewart Gladstone was born on December 29, 1809, at a
house which may still be seen, 62, Rodney Street,
Liverpool.&nbsp; He was of Scotch extraction, his father, a
Liverpool merchant, having an estate in Scotland.&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone senior lived to become one of the merchant princes of
Great Britain, a Baronet, and a Member of Parliament.&nbsp; He
died, at the advanced age of eighty-seven, in 1851.&nbsp; His
wife was Anne, daughter of Andrew Robertson, of Stornoway.&nbsp;
They had six children; William Ewart Gladstone was the
third.&nbsp; The family were all brought up as debaters.&nbsp;
The children and their parents are said to have argued upon
everything.&nbsp; They would debate whether the meat should be
boiled or broiled, whether a window should be shut or opened, and
whether it was likely to be fine or wet next day.</p>
<p>As a little boy, Gladstone went to school at Seaforth, <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>where the late
Dean Stanley was a pupil.&nbsp; The latter is responsible for the
following: &lsquo;There is a small school near Liverpool at which
Mr. Gladstone was brought up before he went to Eton.&nbsp; A few
years ago, another little boy who was sent to this school, and
whose name I will not mention, called upon the old clergyman who
was the headmaster.&nbsp; The boy was now a young man, and he
said to the old clergyman: &ldquo;There is one thing in which I
have never in the least degree improved since I was at
school&mdash;the casting up of figures.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the master, &ldquo;it is very
extraordinary that it should be so, because certainly no one
could be a more incapable arithmetician at school than you were;
but I will tell you a curious thing.&nbsp; When Mr. Gladstone was
at the school, he was just as incapable at addition and
subtraction as you were; now you see what he has become&mdash;he
is one of the greatest of our financiers.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>William Gladstone left home for Eton after the summer holidays
of 1821, the headmaster being Dr. Keate.&nbsp; Sir Roderick
Murchison describes him as &lsquo;the prettiest little boy that
ever went to Eton.&rsquo;&nbsp; From the first he was a hard
student and well behaved, and exercised a good influence over his
schoolfellows.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was a thoroughly idle boy,&rsquo;
said the late Bishop Hamilton of Salisbury, &lsquo;but I was
saved from worse things by getting to know
Gladstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another schoolfellow remembered how he
turned his glass upside down, and refused to drink a coarse toast
proposed according to custom at an election dinner.&nbsp; His
most intimate friend was Arthur Hallam, of whom he wrote an
article in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, which created universal
admiration.&nbsp; He had the courage of his opinions, and when
bantered by some of his associates for his interfering on behalf
of <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>some
ill-used pigs, he offered to write his reply &lsquo;in good round
hand upon their faces.&rsquo;&nbsp; He took no delight in games,
but kept a private boat for his own use, and was a great walker
with his select friends.&nbsp; He was accustomed on holidays to
go as far as Salt Hall, to bully the fat waiter, eat toasted
cheese, and drink egg-wine&mdash;hence he seems to have been
familiarly known as Mr. Tipple.&nbsp; But he soon became
especially distinguished by his editing the <i>Eton
Miscellany</i>, and for his skill in debate at what was commonly
called the Pop.&nbsp; Its meetings were generally held over a
cook-shop, and its politics were intensely Tory, though current
politics were forbidden subjects.&nbsp; His maiden speech was in
favour of education.&nbsp; Eton at that time was not a good
school, writes Sir Francis Doyle; but he testifies strongly to
the virtues of the debating society.&nbsp; He continues:
&lsquo;In the debating society Mr. Gladstone soon distinguished
himself.&nbsp; I had the privilege of listening to his maiden
speech.&nbsp; It began, I recollect, with these words:
&ldquo;Sir, in this age of increasing and still increasing
civilization . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; After Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
arrival, the debating society doubled and trebled itself in point
of numbers, and the discussions became much fuller of interest
and animation.&nbsp; Hallam and Mr. Gladstone took the
lead.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not content with the regular debating society,
Mr. Gladstone and a few others, such as Miles Gaskell and
Canning, established an inner one, held on certain summer
afternoons in the garden of one Trotman.&nbsp; Sir Francis
continues: &lsquo;It happened that my tutor, Mr. Okes, rented a
small garden at the rear of Trotman&rsquo;s, and by some chance
found himself there on the occasion of one of these
debates.&nbsp; To his surprise, he heard three or <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>four boys on
the other side of the wall sneering, shouting, and boohooing in
the most unaccountable manner.&nbsp; There seemed but one
conclusion to him as an experienced Eton tutor&mdash;viz., that
they were what we at the Custom-House used somewhat
euphemistically to term under the influence of liquor.&nbsp; He
thereupon summoned Mr. Gladstone to his study, listened gloomily
and reluctantly to his explanations and excuses, and all but
handed over our illustrious Premier, with his subordinate
orators, to be flogged for drunkenness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wilkinson, in his &lsquo;Reminiscences of Eton,&rsquo;
gives a couplet and its translation by Mr. Gladstone, when a boy
at Eton:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ne sis O cera mollior,<br />
Grandiloquus et vanus;<br />
Heus bone non es gigas tu,<br />
Et non sum ego nanus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tip me now, you lad of wax,<br />
Your blarney and locution;<br />
You&rsquo;re not a giant yet, I hope,<br />
Nor I a Liliputian.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the <i>Miscellany</i>, with which Mr. Gladstone had so
much to do, Sir Francis continues: &lsquo;It would have fallen to
the ground but for Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s energy, perseverance,
and tact.&nbsp; I may as well remark here that my father&mdash;as
I have said elsewhere, a man of great ability as well as of great
experience in life&mdash;predicted Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s future
eminence from the manner in which he handled this somewhat
tiresome business.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;that I think his papers better than yours or
Hallam&rsquo;s&mdash;that is not my meaning at all; but the force
of character he has shown in managing his subordinates
(insubordinates I should <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>rather call them), and the combination
of ability and power that he has made evident, convince me that
such a young man cannot fail to distinguish himself
hereafter.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Further, Sir Francis Doyle writes:
&lsquo;I cannot take leave of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Eton career
without recording a joke of his which, even in this distance of
time, seems calculated to thrill the heart of Midlothian with
horror and dismay.&nbsp; He was then, I must remind my hearers, a
high Tory, and, moreover, used to criticise my passion for the
turf.&nbsp; One day I was steadily computing the odds for the
Derby, as they stood in a morning newspaper.&nbsp; Now, it
happened that the Duke of Grafton owned a colt called Hampden,
who figured in the aforesaid list.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
cried Mr. Gladstone, reading off the odds, &ldquo;Hampden, at any
rate, I see, is in his proper place between <i>Zeal</i> and
<i>Lunacy</i>!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The impression Gladstone made on his schoolfellows at Eton is
clearly shown in a letter of Miles Gaskell to his mother,
pleading for his going to Oxford rather than Cambridge:
&lsquo;Gladstone is no ordinary individual. . . .&nbsp; If you
finally decide in favour of Cambridge, my separation from
Gladstone will be a source of great sorrow to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And Arthur Hallam wrote: &lsquo;Whatever may be our lot, I am
very confident that he is a bud that will blossom with a richer
fragrance than almost any whose early promise I have
witnessed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gladstone, as has already been shown, was one of the principal
members of the staff of the <i>Eton Miscellany</i>.&nbsp; He was
then seventeen, and in one of the articles signed by him he
expressed his fear that he would not be able to direct public
opinion into the right channel.&nbsp; He was aware that merit was
always rewarded, but he asked himself if he possessed that
merit.&nbsp; He dared not <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>presume that he did possess it, though
he felt within him a something which made him hope to be able,
without much hindrance, to gain public favour, and, as Virgil
said, &lsquo;celerare viam rumore secundo.&rsquo;&nbsp; We find
Gladstone the Etonian expressing similar hopes in an article on
&lsquo;Eloquence.&rsquo;&nbsp; The young author shows us himself
and his school-colleagues fascinated by the resounding debates in
the House of Commons, and dreaming, boy-like, of making a
successful Parliamentary d&eacute;but, perhaps being offered a
Government berth&mdash;a Secretaryship of State, even the post of
Prime Minister.&nbsp; While entertaining these ambitious views
Mr. Gladstone calmed his mind by &lsquo;taking to
poetry.&rsquo;&nbsp; Several poetical pieces, including some
verses on &lsquo;Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion,&rsquo; and an ode to
&lsquo;The Shade of Wat Tyler,&rsquo; date from this period.</p>
<p>As a pendant to this fragmentary sketch of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s schooldays, we may quote the lively description
of the young editor given by Sir Francis Doyle in &lsquo;A
Familiar Epistle to W. E. Gladstone, Esq., M.P.,&rsquo; published
in 1841.&nbsp; Sir Francis paints a delightful picture of the
<i>r&eacute;dacteur-en-chef</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Who, in
his editorial den,<br />
Clenched grimly an eradicating pen,<br />
Confronting frantic poets with calm eye,<br />
And dooming hardened metaphors to die.<br />
Who, if he found his young adherents fail,<br />
The ode unfinished, uncommenced the tale,<br />
With the next number bawling to be fed,<br />
And its false feeders latitant or fled,<br />
Sat down unflinchingly to write it all,<br />
And kept the staggering project from a fall.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Furnivall, president of the Maurice Rowing Club, lately
sent Mr. Gladstone a copy of his letter on &lsquo;Sculls or
Oars.&rsquo;&nbsp; The ex-Prime Minister, in returning his <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>thanks for the
letter, says: &lsquo;When I was at Eton, and during the season, I
sculled constantly, more than almost any other boy in the
school.&nbsp; Our boats then were not so light as they now are,
but they went along merrily, with no fear of getting them under
water.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GLADSTONE AT OXFORD.</span></h2>
<p>After spending six months with private tutors, in October,
1828, he went up to Christ Church, Oxford, and the following year
was nominated to a studentship.&nbsp; &lsquo;As for
Gladstone,&rsquo; writes Sir Francis Doyle, &lsquo;in the earlier
part of his undergraduateship he read steadily, and did not exert
himself to shine as a speaker; in point of fact, he did not
attempt to distinguish himself in the Debating Society till he
had pretty well made sure of his distinction in the
Schools.&nbsp; I used often to walk with him in the afternoon,
but I never recollect riding or boating in his company, and I
believe that he was seldom diverted from his normal
constitutional between two and five along one of the Oxford
roads.&nbsp; The most adventurous thing I ever did at Oxford in
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s company, if it really were as adventurous
as I find he still asserts it to have been, was when I allowed
myself to be taken to Dissenting chapels.&nbsp; We were rewarded
by hearing Dr. Chalmers preach on two occasions, and Rowland Hill
at another time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gladstone seems to have delighted in these escapades.&nbsp;
His mother was an occasional attendant on the ministrations of
the celebrated Dissenting preacher Dr. Raffles, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>of Liverpool,
and possibly might have taken the future Premier with her.&nbsp;
His attendance at church was very regular.&nbsp; &lsquo;He used
rather to mount guard over my religious observances,&rsquo;
writes Sir Francis Doyle, &lsquo;and habitually marched me off
after luncheon to the University sermon at two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Now, I have not the gift of snoring
comfortably under a dull preacher; instead of a narcotic he acts
on my nerves as an irritant, but with Mr. Gladstone the case was
different.&nbsp; One afternoon I looked up, and discovered, not
without a glow of triumph, that although the reverend gentleman
above me had not yet arrived at his &ldquo;Thirdly,&rdquo; my
Mentor was sleeping the sleep of the just.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;no more
two-o&rsquo;clock sermons for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, on
the very next occasion when he came to carry me off, my answer
was ready: &ldquo;No, thank you, not to-day.&nbsp; I can sleep
just as well in my arm-chair as at St. Mary&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The great man was discomfited, and retired, shaking his head, but
he acknowledged his defeat by troubling me no more in that
matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cardinal Manning had been the principal leader in the Oxford
Debating Society till Mr. Gladstone appeared upon the
scene.&nbsp; At once he and Gaskell became the leading Christ
Church orators, and the great oratorical event of the time was
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s speech against the first Reform Bill.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Most of the speakers,&rsquo; writes Sir Francis Doyle, who
was present on the occasion, &lsquo;rose more or less above their
ordinary level, but when Mr. Gladstone sat down we all of us felt
that an epoch in our lives had arrived.&nbsp; It was certainly
the finest speech of his that I ever heard.&nbsp; The effect
produced by that great speech led to his being returned to
Parliament as M.P. for Newark by the Tory Duke of <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Newcastle,
who is remembered for his question, &ldquo;May I not do what I
like with my own?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s career at the
University.&nbsp; In 1831 he took a double first-class, and would
easily have attained a Fellowship in any college where
Fellowships depended upon a competitive examination.&nbsp; He
held with Scott, the foremost scholar of the day, the second
place in the Ireland for 1829.&nbsp; In that year a deputation
from the Union of Cambridge went to Oxford to take part in a
debate on the respective merits of Byron and Shelley.&nbsp; One
of the Cambridge party was Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord
Houghton.&nbsp; He writes: &lsquo;The man that took me most was
the youngest Gladstone, of Liverpool&mdash;I am sure a very
superior person.&rsquo;&nbsp; On all he seems to have exercised a
beneficial influence.&nbsp; He deprecated the example of the
gentlemen commoners, and did much to check the pernicious habit
prevalent at that time in the University, of over-indulgence in
wine.&nbsp; His tutor was the Rev. Robert Briscoe.&nbsp; He also
attended the lectures of the Rev. Dr. Benton on divinity and Dr.
Pusey on Hebrew.&nbsp; He read classics privately with a tutor of
the Bishop of St. Andrews.&nbsp; In 1830 he was at Cuddesdon
Vicarage with a small reading-party, where he seems to have
mastered Hooker&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ecclesiastical
Polity.&rsquo;&nbsp; He founded and presided over an essay
society called after his name, of which he was successively
secretary and president.&nbsp; In his maiden speech at the Union
in 1830 he defended Catholic emancipation; declared the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s Government unworthy of the confidence of the
nation; opposed the removal of Jewish disabilities; and argued
for the gradual emancipation of slavery rather than immediate
abolition.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>It is
evident that all the time of his University career Mr. Gladstone
had a profoundly religious bias, and at one time seems to have
contemplated taking Holy Orders.&nbsp; Bishop Wordsworth declared
that no man of his standing read the Bible more or knew it
better.&nbsp; One of his fellow-students writes: &lsquo;Poor
Gladstone mixed himself up with the St. Mary Hall and Oriel set,
who are really for the most part only fit to live with maiden
aunts and keep tame rabbits.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this time Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s High Churchmanship does not seem to have been
so pronounced as it afterwards became.&nbsp; He was a disciple of
Canning, and rejoiced at Catholic emancipation.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
in Scotland, staying at his father&rsquo;s house in
Kincardineshire, he attended the Presbyterian Kirk zealously and
contentedly, and took me with him,&rsquo; writes Sir Francis
Doyle, &lsquo;to what they call the &ldquo;fencing of the
tables,&rdquo; an operation lasting five or six hours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of Gladstone&rsquo;s college acquaintances was Martin
Tupper, whose &lsquo;Proverbial Philosophy&rsquo; had a sale out
of all proportion to its merits, in 1864.&nbsp; He
wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Orator, statesman, scholar, and sage,<br />
The Crichton-more, the Gladstone of his age.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;My first acquaintance with Gladstone,&rsquo; Martin
Tupper writes, &lsquo;was a memorable event.&nbsp; It was at that
time not so common a thing for undergraduates to go to the
Communion at Christ Church Cathedral, that holy celebration being
supposed to be for the particular benefit of Deans and Canons and
Masters of Arts; so when two undergraduates went out of the
chancel together after Communion, which they had both attended,
it is small wonder that they addressed each other genially, in
defiance of Oxford etiquette, nor that a friendship so well begun
has continued to this hour.&rsquo;&nbsp; He testifies <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>how Gladstone
was the foremost man&mdash;warm-hearted, earnest, hard working,
and religious, and had a following even in his teens.</p>
<p>The following anecdote is amusing.&nbsp; Tupper writes:
&lsquo;I had the honour at Christ Church of being prize-taker of
Dr. Benton&rsquo;s theological essay, &ldquo;The Reconciliation
of Matthew and John,&rdquo; when Gladstone, who had also
contested it, stood second, and when Dr. Benton had me before him
to give me the twenty-five pounds&rsquo; worth of books, he
requested me to allow Mr. Gladstone to have five pounds&rsquo;
worth, as he was so good a second.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; Mr.
Tupper in after-life was led to think that the man to whom at one
time he looked up, had deviated from the proper path.&nbsp; In
his &lsquo;Three Hundred Sonnets,&rsquo; he kindly undertook, in
the reference to Gladstone, to warn the public to</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Beware of mere delusive
eloquence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again he wrote of a</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Glozing tongue whom none can
trust.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it is well to quote in this connection how Tupper
considered Gladstone the central figure at Oxford
University.&nbsp; He writes: &lsquo;Fifty years ago
Briscoe&rsquo;s Aristotle class at Christ Church was comprised
almost wholly of men who have since become celebrated, some in a
remarkable degree; and as we believe that so many names
afterwards attaining to great distinction have rarely been
associated at one lecture board, either at Oxford or elsewhere,
it may be allowed to one who counts himself the least and lowest
of the company to pen this brief note of those old
Aristotelians.&nbsp; In this class was Gladstone, ever from youth
up the beloved and admired of many personal intimates.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Miss
Clough&rsquo;s character of Gladstone, solely from his
handwriting, is thus recorded by Lord Houghton: &lsquo;A
well-judging person; a good classic; considerate; apt to mistrust
himself; undecided; if to choose a profession, would prefer the
Church; has much application; a good reasoner; very affectionate
and tender in his domestic relations; has a good deal of pride
and determination, or rather obstinacy; is very fond of society,
particularly ladies&rsquo;; is neat, and fond of
reading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Wordsworth writes: &lsquo;My cousin William Wordsworth,
then living at Eton, was dining at Liverpool at the house of a
great Liverpool merchant just after Gladstone had taken his
degree.&nbsp; Amongst the company were Wordsworth, the poet, and
Mr. John Gladstone, the father of the future Premier.&nbsp; After
dinner, the poet congratulated the father on the success of his
distinguished son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the
father, &ldquo;I thank you.&nbsp; My son has greatly
distinguished himself at the University, and I trust he will
continue to do so when he enters public life, for there is no
doubt that he is a man of great ability, but he has no
stability.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Francis Doyle describes a visit he paid to Gladstone at
his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whilst there,&rsquo; he
writes, &lsquo;I was very much struck with the remarkable
acuteness and great natural powers of Mr. Gladstone the
father.&nbsp; Under his influence, apparently, nothing was taken
for granted between the father and his sons.&nbsp; A succession
of arguments on great topics and small topics
alike&mdash;arguments conducted with perfect good humour, but
also with the most implacable logic&mdash;formed the staple of
the family conversations.&nbsp; Hence, it was easy to see from
what foundations Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s skill as a debater was
built up.&rsquo;&nbsp; Further illustrative traits are
supplied.&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>For instance, one of the amusements of the place was
shooting with bows and arrows.&nbsp; The arrows were lost in the
long grass; Sir Francis would have left them to chance and
time.&nbsp; Not so Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; He insisted on their
being all found.&nbsp; Again, on a trip to Dunottar Castle, Mr.
Gladstone was riding a skittish chestnut mare, who would not let
him open a gate in front of him.&nbsp; &lsquo;My cob,&rsquo; Sir
Francis writes, &lsquo;was perfectly docile, and quiet as a
sheep.&nbsp; I naturally said, &ldquo;Let me do that for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no; his antagonist had to be tamed, but it
took forty minutes to do so, and then the horsemen proceeded on
their way.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is said that Mr. Rarey, the
horse-tamer, subsequently had a high opinion of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s skill as an equestrian.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ENTERS PARLIAMENT.</span></h2>
<p>In 1832 Mr. Gladstone left Oxford, and after spending six
months in Italy, he was recalled to England to become Member for
Newark.&nbsp; In his address he declared that the duties of
governors are strictly and peculiarly religious, and that
legislators, like individuals, are bound to carry throughout
their acts the spirit of the high truths they have
acknowledged.&nbsp; Much required to be done for popular
education, and labour should receive adequate remuneration.&nbsp;
He regarded slavery as sanctioned by Holy Scripture, but he was
in favour of the gradual education and emancipation of the
slaves.&nbsp; It was said that he was the Duke of
Newcastle&rsquo;s nominee.&nbsp; He replied that he was nothing
of the kind&mdash;that he came there by the invitation of the Red
Club, than whom none were more respectable and intelligent.&nbsp;
He was returned at the head of the poll.&nbsp; Newark rejoiced in
two members.&nbsp; Another Tory was second, and the Liberal
candidate, Serjeant Wilde, was defeated.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone
accordingly took his seat in the first Reformed Parliament, which
met in January, 1833.&nbsp; His maiden speech was on the
Anti-slavery Debate, to defend his father from an attack made on
him by Lord <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Howick with regard to the treatment of his slaves in
Demerara.&nbsp; On the morning of the debate, as he was riding in
Hyde Park, a passer-by pointed him out to another new member,
Lord Charles Russell, and said, &lsquo;That is Gladstone; he is
to make his maiden speech to-night; that will be worth
hearing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on Mr. Disraeli&rsquo;s d&eacute;but in the House
of Commons, Professor Prynne writes: &lsquo;This was a contrast
to the graceful, harmonious, almost timid, maiden speech of Mr.
W. E. Gladstone&mdash;a manner that I never saw equalled, except
by Lord Derby when he was in the House of Commons.&nbsp; The
speaking of these two was like a stream pouring foam, or it may
be described as reading from a book.&nbsp; Of Mr. Gladstone we
all agreed in saying, &ldquo;This is a young man of great
promise.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; A foreigner writes that until he had
heard Mr. Gladstone speak he never believed that the English was
a musical language, but that after hearing him he was convinced
that it was the most melodious of living tongues.</p>
<p>About this time there appeared Mr. James Grant&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Random Recollections.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is amusing to read:
&lsquo;I have no idea that he will ever acquire the reputation of
a great statesman.&nbsp; His views are not sufficiently enlarged
or profound for that; his celebrity in the House of Commons will
chiefly depend on his readiness and dexterity as a clever
debater, in conjunction with the excellence of his elocution and
the gracefulness of his manner when speaking.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;When a Select Committee of the House of Commons,&rsquo;
writes Sir George Stephen, &lsquo;was appointed to take evidence
on the working of the apprenticeship system among the West Indian
blacks, it was arranged between Buxton on the one side and <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Gladstone on
the other that Mr. Burge and myself should be admitted as their
respective legal advisers.&nbsp; At that time evidently Mr.
Gladstone had been recognised as the champion of the one party as
much as Mr. Buxton of the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the anti-slavery recollections of Sir George Stephen we
have a graphic account of the struggle between Gladstone, as the
advocate of slavery, and Sir John Jerome, a colonial judge, who
may be said to have died a martyr to his anti-slavery zeal.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall never forget,&rsquo; writes Sir George, &lsquo;his
examination before the Apprenticeship Committee.&nbsp; Gladstone
employed all his ingenuity in vain, and no man has a greater
share of logical acumen, to bewilder him.&nbsp; But Jerome was
quite his match.&nbsp; His evidence was argumentative, and
therefore the cross-examination was in the nature of argument, as
it generally is in Parliamentary Committees.&nbsp; It was a
brilliant affair of thrust and counter-thrust.&nbsp; Gladstone
was calm, imperturbable, and deliberate; Jerome wide-awake, ready
at every point, and, though full of vivacity, as impossible to
catch tripping as a French rope-dancer.&nbsp; He evaded what he
could not answer, but evaded it so adroitly that Gladstone might
detect but could not expose the evasion; and every now and then
Jerome retorted objection to objection with a readiness that made
it difficult to say which was the examiner and which the
examined.&nbsp; The rest of the Committee silently watched the
scene, as a conflict between two practised intellectual
gladiators, and I am persuaded that Mr. Gladstone himself would
admit that Jerome had not the worst of it.&nbsp; But if Mr.
Gladstone had studied in the school of Oxford, Jerome was
educated as an advocate for the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>French Bar, so they met on equal
terms, while Jerome had the advantage of a good cause.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone has been celebrated for his explanations.&nbsp;
One of the earliest of them was written when he was Conservative
candidate for Newark, addressed to a Mr. John Simpson, a
Conservative Nonconformist.&nbsp; It is dated &lsquo;Hawarden,
Chester, July 10, 1841.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sincerely obliged by your transmitting to me the
curious extract contained in your letter of the 6th, as you state
that it has occasioned uneasiness to some of my
constituents.&nbsp; It had not met my eye, but had it done so, I
should have passed it over without notice, trusting to its own
glaring falsity to neutralize its design, just as I remember to
have passed over an amusing sketch in the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>,
shown to me by a friend, which stated that I entered public life
as a Liberal, but ratted to the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert
Peel in 1834, and that I was said openly to avow my readiness to
sell myself to the best bidder.&nbsp; I have not the least
hesitation in disclaiming, in the most emphatic and stringent
language that you can suggest to me, all desire to remove or
abridge the civil privileges at present enjoyed by any class of
my fellow-subjects, or &ldquo;to exercise the civil power&rdquo;
for the purpose of &ldquo;compelling conformity&rdquo; or
&ldquo;extinguishing dissent.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I trust that I
have already in print sufficiently disclaimed any such
desire.&nbsp; With respect to &ldquo;Puseyism,&rdquo; or the
religious part of the question, as your letter does not refer me
to it, I need not here enter upon its discussion further than to
say that I consider it clearly forbidden by my duty as a member
of the Church <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>to recognise any scheme of human opinions in theology as
the basis of my belief, and of my hopes for the Divine mercy, and
that the sum of Christianity, in my view, is that contained in
the ancient Creeds, and demonstrated by the supreme authority of
Scripture.&nbsp; While thus briefly dismissing the question, I
have no desire to evade further inquiry.&nbsp; What I have
published upon these matters now extends to a considerable bulk,
and I could not expect you to undergo the considerable labour of
going through the whole of it.&nbsp; I have, however, desired
that a copy of the third edition of my first book on the
&ldquo;Relations of the Church with the State&rdquo; may be
forwarded to you by an early opportunity.&nbsp; More recently I
have much enlarged the work; but if you will refer to the
portions relating to persecution in that volume, you will, I
think, perceive that I am not among its admirers.&nbsp; You will
find parts particularly bearing on it in Chap. II., 72&ndash;7,
and Chap. VI., 5&ndash;13.&nbsp; This, I hope, may satisfy you
without your undertaking a more extended labour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, dear sir, your faithful servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">W. E.
Gladstone</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are at perfect liberty to make this letter
known.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Parliament Mr. Gladstone defended the Irish Church, and
when in the next session Mr. Hume introduced a
Universities&rsquo; Admission Bill, intended to enable Dissenters
to attend the Universities, Mr. Gladstone strongly opposed
it.&nbsp; Soon after came the Tory reaction, and a General
Election, at which Mr. Gladstone was again returned for Newark,
in conjunction, however, this time with Serjeant Wilde.&nbsp; The
new Parliament met in February, 1835.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone was
then Junior <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Lord of the Treasury in the new Government formed by Sir
Robert Peel, a Government of but very short duration.&nbsp; Sir
Francis Doyle writes: &lsquo;When Mr. Gladstone had established
himself as a rising M.P. at the Albany, he breakfasted there, and
met the poet Wordsworth.&nbsp; The great poet sat in state
surrounded by young and enthusiastic admirers.&nbsp; His
conversation was very like the &ldquo;Excursion,&rdquo; turned
into vigorous prose.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this time Wilberforce,
afterwards Bishop of Oxford and Winchester, wrote to him:
&lsquo;It would be affectation in you, which you are above, not
to know that few young men have the weight you have in the House
of Commons, and are gaining rapidly through the country.&nbsp;
Now, I do not urge you to consider this as a talent for the use
of which you must render an account, for so I know you do esteem
it, but what I want to urge upon you is that you should calmly
look before you&mdash;see the degree of weight and influence to
which you may fairly, if God spares your life and powers, look
forward in future years, and thus act <i>now</i> with a view to
<i>then</i>.&nbsp; There is no height to which you may not fairly
rise in this country.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reply
was not that of an optimist: &lsquo;The principles of civil
government have decayed amongst us as much as I suspect those
which are ecclesiastical, and one does not see an equally ready
or sure provision for their revival.&nbsp; One sees in actual
existence the apparatus by which our institutions are to be
threatened and the very groundwork of the national character is
to be broken up; but on the other hand, if we look around for the
masses of principle&mdash;I mean of enlightened principle blended
with courage and devotion, which are the human means of
resistance&mdash;<i>these</i> I feel have yet to be organized,
almost created.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>In
July, 1838, Mr. W. E. Gladstone wrote to Mr. Murray, the
publisher, from 6, Carlton Gardens, informing him that he has
written and thinks of publishing some papers on the relationship
of the Church and the State, which would probably fill a moderate
octavo volume, and he would be glad to know if Mr. Murray would
be inclined to see them.&nbsp; Mr. Murray saw the papers, and on
August 9 he agreed with Mr. Gladstone to publish 750 or 1,000
copies of the work on Church and State on half-profits, the
copyright to remain with the author after the first edition was
sold.&nbsp; The work was immediately sent to press, and proofs
were sent to Mr. Gladstone, about to embark for Holland.&nbsp; A
note was received from the author, dated from Rotterdam, saying
that sea-sickness prevented him from correcting the proofs on the
passage.&nbsp; This was Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s first appearance as
author, and the work proved remarkably successful.</p>
<p>On receiving a copy of the book Sir Robert Peel exclaimed:
&lsquo;With such a career before him, why should he write
books?&rsquo;&nbsp; In other quarters the book met with a warmer
appreciation.&nbsp; Baron Bunsen wrote: &lsquo;It is the book of
the times&mdash;a great event&mdash;the first since Burke that
goes to the bottom of the question, far above his party and his
times.&nbsp; I sat up till after midnight, and this morning I
continued till I had read the whole.&nbsp; Gladstone is the first
man in England as to intellectual power, and he has heard higher
tones than anyone else in this land.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Arnold was
delighted with it.&nbsp; Newman says to a friend:
&lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;s book, you see, is making a
sensation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he writes: &lsquo;The <i>Times</i>
is again at poor Gladstone; really, I feel as if I could do
anything for him.&nbsp; I have not read his book, <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>but its
consequences speak for it.&nbsp; Poor fellow! it is so noble a
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Henry Taylor wrote: &lsquo;I am reading Gladstone&rsquo;s
book, which I shall send you, if he has not.&nbsp; It is closely
and deeply argumentative, perhaps too much in the nature of a
series of profound corollaries for a book which takes so very
demonstrative a character, leaves one to expect what is
impossible, and to feel drawn on by a postulate; but it is most
able and profound, and written in language which cannot be
excelled for clearness.&nbsp; It is too philosophical to be
generally read, but it will raise his reputation in the opinion
of those who do read it, and will not embarrass him so much in
political life as a popular quotable book on such subjects might
be apt to do.&nbsp; His party speak of him as the man who will be
one day at their head, and certainly no man of his standing has
yet appeared who seems likely to stand in his way.&nbsp; <i>Two
wants</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>may lie across his political
career&mdash;want of robust health and want of
flexibility</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Writing to Mr. John Murray, Lord Mahon, afterwards Lord
Stanhope, says: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s volume has lately
engaged much of my attention.&nbsp; It is difficult to feel quite
free from partiality where so amiable and excellent a man is
concerned; but if my friendship does not blind me, I should
pronounce his production as marked by profound ecclesiastical
learning and eminent native ability.&nbsp; At the same time, I
must confess myself startled at some of his tenets; his doctrine
of Private Judgment especially seems to me a contradiction in
terms, attempting to blend together the incompatible advantages
of the Romanists and of the Protestant principle upon that
point.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Two
years afterwards, we find a reference to the same subject.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As to the third edition of &ldquo;The State in its
Relations to the Church,&rdquo; I should think the remaining
copies had better be got rid of in whatever summary or
ignominious mode you may deem best.&nbsp; They must be dead
beyond recall. . . .&nbsp; With regard to the fourth edition, I
do not know whether it would be well to procure any review or
notice of it, and I am not a fair judge of its merits, even in
comparison with the original form of the work; but my idea is
that it is less defective, both in the theoretical and historical
development, and ought to be worthy of the notice of those who
deemed the earlier editions worth their notice and purchase; that
it really would put a reader in possession of the view it was
intended to convey, which, I fear, is more than can be said of
any of its predecessors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Murray does not seem to have had many letters from Mr.
Gladstone, though Croker mentions his having called on Mr. Murray
to express his dissatisfaction on an article which appeared in
the <i>Quarterly</i> on the Corn Laws.&nbsp; When, in 1843, the
Copyright Bill was the subject of legislation, he wrote to Mr.
Murray: &lsquo;I cannot omit to state that I learn from your note
that steps are being taken here to back the recent proceedings of
the Legislature.&nbsp; I must not hesitate to express my
conviction that what Parliament has done will be fruitless unless
the law be seconded by the adoption of such modes of publication
as will allow the public here and in the colonies to obtain
possession of new and popular English works at moderate prices,
if it be practicable for authors and publishers to make such
arrangements, I should hope to see a great extension of our book
trade, as well as much advantage to <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>literature from the measures that
have now been taken, and from those which I trust we shall be
enabled to take in completion of them.&nbsp; But unless the
proceedings of the trade itself adapt and adjust themselves to
the altered circumstances, I can feel no doubt that we shall
relapse into or towards the old state of things&mdash;the law
will be first evaded and then relaxed.&rsquo;&nbsp; This sensible
hint of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s does not seem to have been entirely
thrown away&mdash;at any rate, as far as Mr. Murray was
concerned.</p>
<p>About the same time Mr. Gladstone seems to have been not a
little moved by our military proceedings in India.&nbsp; When
Lieutenant Eyre&rsquo;s &lsquo;Military Operations in
Cabool&rsquo; appeared, Mr. Murray sent Mr. Gladstone a
copy.&nbsp; He replied: &lsquo;I have read it with great pain and
shame, which are, I fear, as one must say in such a case, the
tests of its merits as a work.&nbsp; May another occasion for
such a narrative never arise!&rsquo;&nbsp; A humane wish, as
subsequent events show, not likely to be speedily realized.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Church and State&rsquo; soon reached a third edition,
and led to the famous review of it by Macaulay, in which he
speaks of Gladstone as &lsquo;the rising hope of the stern and
unbending Tories.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have bought
Gladstone&rsquo;s book on Church and State,&rsquo; he writes to
Macvey Napier, &lsquo;and I think I can make a good article on
it.&nbsp; It seems to me the very thing for a spirited, popular,
and at the same time gentlemanlike, critique.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again
he writes: &lsquo;I met Gladstone at Rome.&nbsp; We talked and
walked together in St. Peter&rsquo;s during the best part of an
afternoon, and I have in consequence been more civil to him
personally than I otherwise should have been.&nbsp; He is both a
clever and an able man, with all his fanaticism.&rsquo;&nbsp; At
this time <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Gladstone&rsquo;s eyesight failed him, and the doctors
recommended him to spend the winter at Rome, where he met,
besides Macaulay, Henry Manning and Cardinal Wiseman and Grant,
who afterwards became Roman Catholic Bishop of Southwark.&nbsp;
Among the visitors at Rome that winter were the widow and
daughters of Sir Stephen Richard Glynne, of Hawarden Castle,
Flintshire.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone was already acquainted with these
ladies, having been a friend of Lady Glynne&rsquo;s eldest son at
Oxford and having also met him at Hawarden.&nbsp; The visit to
Rome threw him much into their society, and he became engaged to
Lady Glynne&rsquo;s eldest daughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In 1839,&rsquo; writes Sir Francis Doyle, &lsquo;I
attended Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s wedding at Hawarden as his best
man.&nbsp; Catherine Glynne and her sister Mary, both beautiful
women, were married on the same day&mdash;the first to William
Gladstone, the second to Lord Lyttelton.&nbsp; The occasion was a
very interesting one from the high character of the two
bridegrooms and the warmth of affection shown for the two
charming young ladies by all their friends and neighbours in
every rank of life.&nbsp; There was a depth and genuineness of
sympathy diffused around which, as the French say, spoke for
itself without any words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the early part of their married life Mr. and Mrs.
Gladstone lived with Sir Thomas Gladstone at 6, Carlton
Gardens.&nbsp; Later they lived at 13, Carlton House Terrace, and
when Mr. Gladstone was in office occupied an official residence
in Downing Street.&nbsp; In 1850, Mr. Gladstone, who had
succeeded to his patrimony five years before, bought 11, Carlton
House Terrace, which was his London house for twenty years, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and he
subsequently lived in Harley Street, where on one occasion an
angry mob smashed his windows.&nbsp; During the Parliamentary
recess Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone divided their time between Fasque,
Sir John Gladstone&rsquo;s seat in Kincardineshire, and Hawarden
House, which they shared with Mrs. Gladstone&rsquo;s brother, Sir
Stephen Glynne, till, on his death, it passed into their sole
possession.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone had a numerous family.&nbsp; His
eldest son predeceased him; his second son is known as Herbert
Gladstone; another was Henry Gladstone.&nbsp; One of his
daughters married the Rev. Mr. Drew.</p>
<p>It is interesting to read what an American writer has to say
of Mrs. Gladstone: &lsquo;The French have a derisive saying that
there are no political women in England, and hence no salons in
London.&nbsp; They have no appreciation of that class of
Englishwomen, who are far more important and beneficial to
society than are the corresponding class in France.&nbsp; But
there is a social factor in English politics unattainable by any
other nation, and possibly only under just such a form of
Government and with such a ruler as Queen Victoria has proved
herself to be.&nbsp; She is in a large sense the leader of the
woman movement in her country&mdash;a movement which is
represented in a stricter sense by Mrs. Gladstone, the wife of
England&rsquo;s foremost statesman.&nbsp; In this movement are no
diplomats or political female deputies; but women who, knowing
the practical work that must be done for humanity, are about it
in earnest fashion, giving the world fitting examples of their
ability and power as women and workers.&nbsp; To better the
condition of the people, not to scheme and wire-pull for a party,
is the aim of women like Mrs. Gladstone, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>whose social
power is stronger than the strongest political influence that
exists.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a noble woman, aside from the fact that her
position is so exceptional that her faults would naturally seem
trivial, surrounded by the halo of her rank and her
husband&rsquo;s fame.&nbsp; As a little child she exhibited the
unselfishness which has made her name beloved in England.&nbsp;
Her father said of her that she was his most gifted child, and
always spoke with subdued pride of the strong character she
exhibited in earliest youth.&nbsp; She chose as a schoolgirl the
motto, &ldquo;If you want a thing well done, do it
yourself,&rdquo; and has kept it as hers through life.&nbsp; The
practical good sense manifested by her when young has been her
magic wand through all the passing years.&nbsp; She is now a
woman of seventy-six years, and is the same wise-minded, sensible
person that she was when she wrote her chosen sentence in her
diary fully seventy years ago.&nbsp; The story of her life would
read like a beautiful romance, so full has it been of work,
domestic, social, and philanthropic, and so overflowing with
happiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The variety and interest which have marked Mrs.
Gladstone&rsquo;s life would have been lacking to a large extent
had she not felt such an overflowing sympathy for the
people&mdash;for the poor and trouble-burdened, the weary and the
faint-hearted.&nbsp; One of her friends was once lamenting to her
that she could do nothing for others because she had not
means.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, you can, my dear: you can do
everything; you can love them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But that would
not help the poor or the sick or the dying,&rdquo; was
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it would; it would cheer and bless
and comfort; try it and prove my words,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gladstone, and her visitor parted <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>from her in tears, so heartfelt and
earnest were her words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The story of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s public career is in
part his wife&rsquo;s; for in all his undertakings she has been a
powerful factor.&nbsp; Wherever he has journeyed she has gone: in
whatever work he has been engaged she has been at his side,
mastering details and keeping pace with him, so that she has been
his comrade in all things.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone at all times, and
on every fitting occasion, pays tribute to the mind and heart of
his wife, and attributes to her companionship and encouragement
the stimulus and the solace without which he could not have
undertaken the tasks he has performed.&nbsp; She was his
&ldquo;helpmeet&rdquo; from their earliest union, and as time
passed and their affection for each other grew as a protecting
shelter about them, he relied more and more upon her
counsels.&nbsp; Always at his side ministering to him and
diverting his mind by steady cheerfulness and bright talk, she
has made his life an exceptionably joyous one, and she basks in
the sunshine of the happiness she has created.&nbsp; For many
years, while her children were growing up about her and needing
her watchful care, she had manifold duties, but for a long time
there has been no divided responsibility, and the accustomed way
for both of them has been together, and together in a union so
close that it is really that exceptional thing&mdash;a
soul-marriage.&nbsp; She alone has shared alike in his labours
and his recreations, his triumphs and defeats, and, beyond all
the incidents of their united lives, her unselfish devotion has
been his staff and his support.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s manners, especially when
addressing ladies, are very courtly.&nbsp; There is a fine
stateliness, and <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>at the same time an exquisite courtesy, in his
address.&nbsp; In his manners, as well as in much else, Mr.
Gladstone belongs distinctly to the older school which flourished
before the Queen came to the throne, when society still preserved
a certain distinctive style, which has suffered much in the rush
and tumble of our new democracy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s &lsquo;Church Principles and
Government&rsquo; appeared in 1840.&nbsp; Macaulay writes to
Napier: &lsquo;I do not think it would be wise to review
it.&nbsp; I observed in it very little that had reference to
politics&mdash;very little, indeed, that could not consistently
be said by a supporter of the voluntary principle.&nbsp; It is,
in truth, a theological treatise, and I have no mind to engage in
a controversy about the nature of the Sacraments, the operation
of Holy Orders, the validity of the Church, and such points of
learning, except where they are connected with questions of
Government.&nbsp; I have no disposition to split hairs about the
spiritual reception of the body and blood of Christ in the
Eucharist, or about baptismal regeneration.&rsquo;&nbsp; However,
it was subsequently reviewed in the <i>Edinburgh</i> by Henry
Roger, of Spring Hill College, Birmingham, in an article on the
Right of Private Judgment.&nbsp; Dr. Arnold writes how he was
disappointed with the book.&nbsp; Newman writes: &lsquo;It is not
open to the objections I feared; it is doctrinaire, and I think
self-confident, but it will do good.&rsquo;&nbsp; Maurice thus
criticised it: &lsquo;His Aristotelianism is, it strikes me, more
deeply fixed in him than before, and on that account I do not see
how he can ever enter into the feeling and truths of Rationalism
to refute it.&nbsp; His notion of attacking the Evangelicals by
saying, Press your opinions to these results, and they become
Rationalistic, is ingenious, and thought out, I think, with great
skill and an analytical <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>power for which I had not given him
credit; but after all, it seems to me, an argument which is
better for the courts than for a theological
controversy.&rsquo;&nbsp; At Eton, about this time, he was almost
worshipped.&nbsp; When he went there to examine the candidates
for the Newcastle Scholarship, one of the candidates wrote:
&lsquo;I wish you to understand that Mr. Gladstone appeared not
to me only but to others as a gentleman wholly unlike other
examiners of school people.&nbsp; It was not as a politician we
admired him, but as a refined Churchman deep also in political
philosophy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1841 he accepted the office of Vice-President of the Board
of Trade under Sir Robert Peel, afterwards becoming President as
successor to Lord Ripon.&nbsp; In his address seeking re-election
at Newark, he declared that the British farmer might rely upon
two points&mdash;first, &lsquo;that adequate protection would be
given to him; secondly, that protection would be given him
through the means of the sliding scale.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1842 he
was engaged in the preparation of the revised tariff, by which
duties were either abolished or diminished on some twelve hundred
articles.&nbsp; Greville writes in the March of that year that he
had already displayed a capacity which made his admission into
the Cabinet indispensable.&nbsp; In the course of the next year
he became President of the Board of Trade and a member of the
Cabinet, and the very first act he had to perform was to give his
vote in favour of withdrawing the Bill providing for the
education of children in factories, which had been violently
opposed by the Dissenters on the plea that it was too favourable
to the Established Church.&nbsp; In this connection we have the
following curious story: A brusque but wealthy shipowner of
Sunderland once entered the London office of <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Mr. Lindsay
on business.&nbsp; &lsquo;Noo, is Lindsay in?&rsquo; inquired the
northern diamond in the rough.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; exclaimed
the clerk to whom the inquiry was addressed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
then, is Mr. Lindsay in, seest thou?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He will
be in shortly,&rsquo; said the clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you
wait?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Sunderland shipowner intimated that he
would, and was ushered into an adjacent room, where a person was
busily employed copying some statistics.&nbsp; Our Sunderland
friend paced the room several times, and presently, walking to
the table where the other occupant of the room was seated, took
careful note of the writer&rsquo;s doings.&nbsp; The copier
looked up inquiringly, when the northerner said: &lsquo;Thou
writest a bonny hand, thou dost.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am glad
you think so,&rsquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! thou
dost&mdash;thou maks thy figures well; thou&rsquo;rt just the
chap I want.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said the
Londoner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; said Sunderland.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m a man of few words.&nbsp; Noo, if thou&rsquo;lt
coom o&rsquo;er to canny auld Sunderland, thou seest, I&rsquo;ll
gie thee a hoondred and twenty pund a year, and that&rsquo;s a
plum thou doesn&rsquo;t meet with every day in thy life, I
reckon&mdash;noo then.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Londoner thanked the
admirer of his penmanship most gratefully, and intimated that he
would like to consult Mr. Lindsay upon the subject.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s reet!&rsquo;&nbsp; And in walked Mr.
Lindsay, who cordially greeted his Sunderland friend, after which
the gentleman at the desk gravely rose and informed Mr. Lindsay
of the handsome appointment which had been offered him in the
Sunderland shipowner&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
well,&rsquo; said Mr. Lindsay, &lsquo;I should be sorry to stand
in your way; a hundred and twenty pound is more than I can afford
to pay you in the department in which you are at present
placed.&nbsp; You will find my friend a good and kind master,
and, <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>under
the circumstances, I think the sooner you know each other the
better.&nbsp; Allow me, therefore, to introduce to you the Right
Hon. W. Gladstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone had been engaged in
making a note of some shipping returns for his budget.&nbsp; The
shipowner was, of course, a little taken aback, but he soon
recovered his self-possession, and enjoyed the joke as much as
Mr. Gladstone did.&nbsp; Very soon Sir Robert Peel proposed to
establish non-sectarian colleges in Ireland, and to increase the
grant to Maynooth.&nbsp; This led to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
resignation in 1845, but not before he had completed a second
revised tariff, carrying on still further the work of commercial
reform.&nbsp; In the explanation which he gave for his
resignation he was understood to say that the measure with regard
to Maynooth was a departure from the principles he had contended
for in his books.</p>
<p>Everyone was amazed, and the party he had left was very
angry.&nbsp; Greville writes: &lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;s
explanation was ludicrous.&nbsp; Everybody said that he had only
succeeded in showing that his explanation was quite uncalled
for.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is perfectly clear that no one was able to
understand the explanation.&nbsp; In a letter to Mr. W. E.
Forster, Cobden wrote: &lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;s speeches have the
effect on my mind of a beautiful strain of music; I can rarely
remember any clear unqualified expression of opinion on any
subject outside his political, economical and financial
statements.&nbsp; I remember on the occasion when he left Sir
Robert Peel&rsquo;s Government on the Maynooth question, and when
the House sat in unusual numbers to hear his explanation, I sat
beside Villiers and Ricardo for an hour listening with real
pleasure to his beautiful rhetorical involutions and evolutions,
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and at the
close turning round to one of my neighbours and exclaiming,
&ldquo;What a marvellous talent is this!&nbsp; Here have I been
listening with pleasure for an hour to his explanation, and I
know no more why he left the Government than when he
commenced.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little prior to this speech Mr. Gladstone had secured a
follower in the person of Mr. Stafford Northcote, afterwards Lord
Iddesleigh, as private secretary.&nbsp; &lsquo;From what I know
of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s character,&rsquo; writes Mr. Northcote
to his father, &lsquo;there is no single statesman of the present
day to whom I would more gladly attach myself; and I should
think, from the talent he has shown for business since he came
into office, there is no one more likely to retain his place
unless any revolution takes place.&rsquo;&nbsp; To another
friend, Mr. Northcote, on his acceptance of the office, writes:
&lsquo;With any other man than Gladstone I might have hesitated
longer.&nbsp; But he is one whom I respect beyond measure; he
stands almost alone as the representative of principles with
which I cordially agree; and as a man of business, and one who,
humanly speaking, is sure to rise, he is
pre-eminent.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little later Mr. Northcote writes to
a lady: &lsquo;I look upon him&rsquo; (Gladstone) &lsquo;as the
representative of the party scarcely developed as yet, though
secretly forming, which will stand by all that is dear and
sacred, in my estimation, in the struggle which will come ere
very long between good and evil, order and disorder, the Church
and the world; and I see a very small band collecting around him,
and ready to fight manfully under his leading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to a friend, Mr. Gladstone thus explains his
retirement from office: &lsquo;My whole purpose was to place
myself in a position in which I should be free to consider <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>my course
without being liable to any just suspicion on the ground of
personal interest.&nbsp; It is not profane if I say, &ldquo;With
a great price obtained I this freedom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The political
association in which I stood was to me, at the time, the Alpha
and Omega of public life.&nbsp; The Government of Sir Robert Peel
was believed to be of immovable strength.&nbsp; My place, as
President of the Board of Trade, was at the very kernel of its
most interesting operations . . .&nbsp; I felt myself open to the
charge of being opinionated and wanting in deference to really
great authorities, and I could not but see that I should be
evidently regarded as fastidious and fanciful, fitter for a
dreamer, or possibly a schoolman, than for the active purposes of
public life in a busy and moving age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While at the Board of Trade Mr. Gladstone found time to devote
himself as ardently as ever to ecclesiastical subjects.&nbsp; He
was one of the party supremely interested in the establishment of
an Anglican Bishop at Jerusalem.&nbsp; Lord Shaftesbury describes
how, in connection with the event at a dinner given by Baron
Bunsen, &lsquo;he&rsquo; (Gladstone) &lsquo;stripped himself of a
part of his Puseyite garment, and spoke like a pious
man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bunsen, writing of Gladstone&rsquo;s speech,
says: &lsquo;Never was heard a more exquisite speech: it flowed
like a gentle and translucent stream. . . .&nbsp; We drove back
to town in the clearest starlight, Gladstone continuing, with
unabated animation, to pour forth his harmonious thoughts in
melodious tones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1845 Mr. Gladstone contemplated a visit to Ireland.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ireland,&rsquo; he writes to an Oxford friend, &lsquo;is
likely to find this country and Parliament so much occupation for
years to come that I feel rather oppressively an obligation to
try and see it with my own eyes, instead <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of using
those of other people, according to the limited measure of my
means.&rsquo;&nbsp; The visit, however, was not paid.&nbsp; He
went to see Dr. Dollinger at Munich instead.</p>
<p>In the winter Mr. Gladstone, while out shooting, met with an
accident that necessitated the amputation of the first finger of
his left hand.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that early in his official career Mr.
Gladstone was Under-Secretary for the Colonies under Lord
Aberdeen.&nbsp; Henry Taylor, who was then one of the permanent
officials, writes: &lsquo;I rather like Gladstone, but he is said
to have more of the devil in him than appears, in a virtuous
way&mdash;that is, only self-willed.&nbsp; He may be all the more
useful here for that.&nbsp; His amiable looks and manners deluded
Sir James Stephen, who said that for success in public life he
wanted pugnacity.&rsquo;&nbsp; By the time he quitted office,
Taylor owns that they had come to know him better.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gladstone left with us a paper on negro education, which
confirmed me in the impression that he is a very considerable
man&mdash;by far the most so of any man I have seen among our
rising statesmen.&nbsp; He has, together with his abilities,
great strength of character and excellent
disposition.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a letter to his friend Hudson
Gurney, Lord Aberdeen, one of the ablest statesmen modern England
has known, writes: &lsquo;In consequence of the defeat of my
Under-Secretary in the county of Forfar, I have been obliged to
appoint another.&nbsp; I have chosen a young man whom I did not
know, and whom I never saw, but of whose good character and
abilities I have often heard.&nbsp; He is the young Gladstone,
and I hope he will do well.&nbsp; He has no easy part to play in
the House of Commons, but it is a fine opening for a young man of
talent and ambition, and <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>places him in the way to the highest
distinction.&nbsp; He appears to me so amiable that I am sure,
personally, I shall like him.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is interesting in
this connection to note Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s opinion of Lord
Aberdeen.&nbsp; He thus describes the interview: &lsquo;I knew
Lord Aberdeen only by public rumour.&nbsp; I had heard of his
high character, but I had also heard of him as a man of cold
manners and close and even haughty reserve.&nbsp; It was dusk
when I entered the room, so that I saw his figure rather than his
countenance, and I remember well that before I had been three
minutes with him all my apprehensions had melted away like snow
in the sun, and I came away from that interview conscious
indeed&mdash;as who could not fail to be conscious&mdash;of his
dignity, but of a dignity so tempered by a peculiar purity and
gentleness, and so associated with impressions of his kindness
and even friendship, that I believe I thought more about the
wonder at that time of his being so misunderstood by the outer
world than about the new duties and responsibilities of my new
office.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ministers were beaten by Lord John Russell,
who carried a resolution in favour of applying the surplus
revenues of the Irish Church to general education, and Mr.
Gladstone retired to private life, working hard at his chambers
in the Albany, studying mainly Homer and Dante and St.
Augustine.&nbsp; He went freely into society, though refusing to
attend Mr. Monckton Milnes&rsquo; Sunday evening parties.&nbsp;
He was a frequent attendant at St. James&rsquo;s, Piccadilly, and
at All Saints&rsquo;, Margaret Street&mdash;all the while
speaking when occasion required in Parliament and working hard on
Committees.</p>
<h2><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">M.P. FOR OXFORD UNIVERSITY.</span></h2>
<p>In 1845 the Whigs, failing to form a Cabinet, resigned, and
Sir Robert Peel was again in office to carry the abolition of the
Corn Laws.&nbsp; After resigning office, Mr. Gladstone published
a pamphlet on &lsquo;Recent Commercial Legislation,&rsquo; the
tendency of which was in favour of the conclusion that all
materials of industry should, as far as possible, be set free
from Custom duties.&nbsp; When Lord Stanley refused to accompany
his chief in the achievement of Free Trade in corn, Mr. Gladstone
became, in his place, Secretary of State for the Colonies.&nbsp;
But the Duke of Newcastle would not allow Mr. Gladstone his seat
for Newark&mdash;he had turned his own son, Lord Lincoln, out of
the representation of Nottingham for a similar reason&mdash;and
Mr. Gladstone was out of Parliament when the question of Free
Trade was being fought and won.&nbsp; Early in 1847 it was
announced that there would be a vacancy in the representation of
Oxford, and Mr. Gladstone was selected for the vacant seat.&nbsp;
It was known to all that to represent Oxford University was Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s desire, as it had been that of Canning.&nbsp;
In May, 1847, a meeting was held in Oxford in favour of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s candidature.&nbsp; The canvassing went <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>on with more
than the usual excitement in a University constituency.&nbsp;
There was an electioneering Gladstonian rhyme worth
preserving.&nbsp; The anti-Gladstonians had difficulty in finding
a candidate.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A cipher&rsquo;s sought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cipher&rsquo;s found;<br />
His work is nought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His name is Round.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question for the electors was, as Mr. Gladstone put it,
&lsquo;Whether political Oxford shall get shifted out of her
pal&aelig;ozoic position into one more suited to her position and
work as they now stand.&rsquo;&nbsp; On August 2 Mr. Gladstone
writes that he heard, not without excitement, the horse&rsquo;s
hoofs of the messenger bearing the news of the poll.&nbsp; He was
elected by a majority of 173 over Mr. Round, the senior member,
Sir Robert Inglis, being some 700 votes in advance of him.&nbsp;
Mr. Hope Scott has left it on record that Mrs. Gladstone was a
copious worker on her husband&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; Sir Robert
Peel went down to vote for his colleague.&nbsp; The venerable Dr.
Routh, then nearly ninety-two years old, left his seclusion at
Magdalen College to vote for him.&nbsp; The feeling of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s supporters may be summed up in a letter written
by Dr. Moberly, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester, to a doubtful
voter:</p>
<p>&lsquo;For my own part, I certainly disapprove of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s vote on the godless colleges in Ireland, and I
am not sure, even though I acknowledge the difficulties of the
case, whether I approve of that respecting Maynooth; but I feel
that I am not specially called on to reward or punish individual
voters as to select <i>the deepest</i>, <i>truest</i>, <i>most
attached</i>, <i>most efficient advocate for the Church and
Universities</i> in coming, and very probably serious,
dangers.&nbsp; I think <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>your correspondence with
Gladstone&rsquo;s committee has probably done great good.&nbsp;
It is very useful that Gladstone should know that there are those
who are not satisfied with some of his past acts; but surely you
will not press this hitherto useful course to the extreme result
of refraining from voting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone still continued in politics to uphold
Conservative traditions, apart from Free Trade.&nbsp; He opposed
marriage with a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister; he deprecated the
appointment of a Commission to inquire into the Universities; but
he vindicated the policy of admitting Jews to Parliament, and
defended the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Court
of Rome.&nbsp; He supported the alteration of the Parliamentary
oath, but was opposed to an abstract attack on Church
rates.&nbsp; One domestic sorrow befell him about this time, the
death of a little daughter, Catherine, between four and five
years old.&nbsp; Another difficulty which gave him much trouble
was on an affair which agitated all England at one time, and was
known as the Gorham case.&nbsp; Mr. Gorham was an Evangelical
clergyman, and the Bishop of Exeter refused to institute on the
ground that his views on baptism were not sound; but in March,
1850, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that his
teaching was not such as to debar him from preferment in the
Church of England.&nbsp; In a letter addressed to the Bishop of
London (Bloomfield), entitled &lsquo;The Royal Supremacy viewed
in the Light of Reason, History, and Common-sense,&rsquo; Mr.
Gladstone contended that the Royal Supremacy was not inconsistent
with the spiritual life and inherent jurisdiction of the Church,
and that the recent establishment of the Privy Council as a <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>final court
of appeal in religious causes was an injurious, and even
dangerous, departure from the Reformation settlement.&nbsp; The
Bishops, he held, when &lsquo;acting jointly, publicly, solemnly,
responsibly, are the best and most natural organs of the judicial
office of the Church in matters of heresy, and, according to
reason, history, and the Constitution in that subject-matter, the
fittest and safest counsellors of the Crown.&rsquo;&nbsp; To that
controversy it is due to a great extent that Mr. Hope Scott and
Dr. Manning went over to the Church of Rome&mdash;the two men on
whom in Church matters Mr. Gladstone principally relied.&nbsp;
The blow was severe.&nbsp; &lsquo;I felt,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gladstone, &lsquo;as if I had lost my two eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this year Mr. Gladstone was very much depressed.&nbsp; Sir
Stafford Northcote writes: &lsquo;He (Gladstone) was out of
spirits himself about public matters, and did not paint
Parliamentary life in rose colour. . . .&nbsp; He is distressed
at the position Peel has taken up, and at the want of sympathy
between those who had acted for so many years cordially together,
and he looks forward to serious Church troubles, which he thinks
might possibly drive him out of Parliament.&rsquo;&nbsp; An idea
which, had it been carried out, would have deprived the world of
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s greatest triumphs, political and
oratorical.&nbsp; In that year came up the Don Pacifico affair,
and Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s triumph by means of the <i>Romanus
civis sum</i> dictum, against which Mr. Gladstone
thundered.&nbsp; It was, as Lord Palmerston admitted, a
first-rate performance, appealing to the law of Nature and of
God, and deprecating the vain conception that we, forsooth, have
a mission to be the censors of vice and folly, of abuse and
imperfection, among the other countries of the world, a doctrine
which Mr. Gladstone <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>subsequently seemed altogether to have departed
from.</p>
<p>On the lamented death of Sir Robert Peel, Mr. Gladstone bore
eloquent testimonies to the merits of that great man.</p>
<p>In the following winter Mr. Gladstone was in Naples, taken
there by the illness of one of his children, for whom the medical
men had recommended a warmer climate, and thence he addressed to
the Earl of Aberdeen those letters denouncing the atrocities of
the Italian Government which for the first time made Mr.
Gladstone popular with the English people.</p>
<p>On his return, he found the country excited to a temporary
fury, because the Pope had planned Roman Bishops in English
counties.&nbsp; To meet it, Lord John Russell carried an
Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, which Mr. Gladstone powerfully
attacked, and which some twenty years after he had the pleasure
of quietly repealing.&nbsp; But the Bill proved a death-blow to
Lord John Russell&rsquo;s hold on office, weakened as it was by
Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s retirement, in consequence of his
unauthorized recognition of Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s <i>coup
d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>.&nbsp; Lord Derby came into office, and
there was a General Election.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone was sent by Lord Derby as a Lord Commissioner to
the Ionian Islands, to carry out needed reforms in that part of
the world, Her Majesty Queen Victoria having refused her assent
to the petition of the Ionian Parliament for union with
Greece.&nbsp; But Mr. Gladstone was to reform the Ionian
Parliament, so as to make it resemble as much as possible that of
England.&nbsp; When he left, his successor, Sir H. Stocks, wrote:
&lsquo;Gladstone is regretted by many, respected by all.&nbsp;
Nothing <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>could have been better than the firmness, judgment, and
temper and talent he has shown.&nbsp; It sometimes staggers me to
reflect that I have to succeed him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was about this time that M. Thiers paid England a visit,
having left France in consequence of the <i>coup
d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>.&nbsp; A dinner was made up for him, at
which were present Mr. Gladstone, Bulwer the novelist, Lord
Elcho, Lord Herbert of Lea, Mr. Hayward, and others.&nbsp; The
conversation was varied and animated.&nbsp; Mr. Hayward writes:
&lsquo;Thiers had the advantage of language and choice of
subject, but the general opinion was that Mr. Gladstone was, if
anything, the superior conversationalist of the two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the election of 1852 approached, the opponents of Mr.
Gladstone, thinking that his friends might have been alienated by
his votes on Jewish disabilities and on the Papal Aggressions
Bill, brought forward a third candidate for the University, Dr.
Marsham, of Merton, in spite of a declaration signed by 1,276
members; but Mr. Gladstone managed to secure a majority of
350.&nbsp; In the debate in November Mr. Gladstone attacked Mr.
Disraeli&rsquo;s Budget, and at the election following the Tories
again attacked Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s seat.&nbsp; The opposition
was a curious affair&mdash;the result of an obscure
intrigue&mdash;Lord Crompton being put forward apparently without
his consent and against his wish.&nbsp; Then Mr. Percival was
suddenly brought forward.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, however, on a
small poll, had a majority of 87, and his seat was saved for the
time.&nbsp; As a rule, a University M.P. is supposed to hold his
seat for life.</p>
<p>By this time the Tories had become outrageous against Mr.
Gladstone.&nbsp; After the defeat of the Derby Government, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>some of them
gave a dinner to Major Beresford at the Carlton, who had been
charged with bribery at the Derby election, and had been
acquitted.&nbsp; &lsquo;After dinner,&rsquo; writes Mr. Greville,
&lsquo;when they got drunk, they went upstairs, and found Mr.
Gladstone alone in the drawing-room.&nbsp; Some of them proposed
to throw him out of the window.&nbsp; This they did not quite
dare do, but contented themselves with giving an insulting
message or order to the waiter, and then went away.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But Mr. Gladstone remained a member of the club till 1859.&nbsp;
On the Coalition Government being formed under Lord Aberdeen, Mr.
Gladstone became Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp; His Budget
speech, five hours long, held the House spell-bound.&nbsp; It was
devoted mainly to remission of taxation.&nbsp; The deficiency
thus created was made up by the application of the legacy duty to
real property, by an increase of the duty on spirits, and by an
extension of the income-tax at 5d. in the pound to all incomes
between &pound;100 and &pound;150.&nbsp; The Irish were indignant
at the tax being extended to Ireland.&nbsp; One of the few
genuine Irish patriots, Mr. J. O&rsquo;Neil Daunt, writes:
&lsquo;One of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s arguments is curious from its
dishonest ingenuity.&nbsp; He extracts from our poverty a pretext
for disarming us.&nbsp; Pitt and Castlereagh promised at the
Union that Irish taxation should not be approximated to British
until an increased prosperity should enable us to bear the
increased burden.&nbsp; The prosperity has not come, but the tax
must be got.&nbsp; If, says Gladstone, you have not got wealth to
be mulcted, your poverty will answer me quite as well.&nbsp; For
the purchasing power of &pound;150 is greater in a poor country
than a rich one; whence he argues that, as Ireland is <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>poor, an
Irish income of &pound;150 is a fitter subject of taxation than
an income of equal amount in England.&nbsp; The peculiar beauty
of this argument is, that the poorer a country is, the stronger
is the force of argument for taxing it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Evidently
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Budget found more favour in English than in
Irish eyes.&nbsp; The income-tax, said Mr. Gladstone, was to
expire in 1860.&nbsp; Alas! he did not then foresee the Crimean
War.&nbsp; On the contrary, everything seemed to betoken a happy
future.</p>
<p>In May, 1853, Mr. Greville records an interview he had with
Sir James Graham.&nbsp; &lsquo;Graham seemed in excellent spirits
about their political state and prospects, all owing to Gladstone
and the complete success of the Budget.&nbsp; The long and
numerous Cabinets, which were attributed in the <i>Times</i> to
disunion, were occupied in minute consideration of the Budget,
which was there fully discussed; and Gladstone spoke in the
Cabinet one day for three hours, rehearsing his speech in the
House of Commons, though not quite at such length. . . .&nbsp; He
talked of a future head, as Aberdeen is always quite ready to
retire; but it is very difficult to find anyone to succeed
him.&nbsp; I suggested Gladstone.&nbsp; He shook his head, and
said it would not do.&nbsp; He spoke of the great mistakes Derby
had made.&nbsp; Gladstone&rsquo;s object certainly was for a long
time to be at the head of the Conservative party in the House of
Commons, and to join with Derby, who might, in fact, have had all
the Peelites, if he had chosen to ally himself with them instead
of Disraeli.&nbsp; The latter had been the cause of the ruin of
the party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same year Bishop Wilberforce wrote: &lsquo;Lord
Aberdeen is now growing to look upon Gladstone as his successor,
and so told Gladstone the other day.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>A
little while after we find Lord Aberdeen saying: &lsquo;Gladstone
intends to be Prime Minister.&nbsp; He has great qualifications,
but some serious defects.&nbsp; The chief is that when he has
convinced himself, perhaps, by abstract reasoning of some view,
he thinks that everyone ought at once to see as he does, and can
make no allowance for difference of opinion.&nbsp; Gladstone must
thoroughly recover his popularity.&nbsp; The Queen has quite got
over her feeling against him, and likes him much. . . .&nbsp; I
have told Gladstone that when he is Prime Minister I will have a
seat in his Cabinet, if he desires it, without an
office.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. GLADSTONE&rsquo;S ECCLESIASTICAL
OPINIONS.</span></h2>
<p>In April, 1856, Mr. Greville writes of a conversation he had
with Graham: &lsquo;He began talking over the state of affairs
generally.&nbsp; He says there is not one man in the House of
Commons who has ten followers&mdash;neither Gladstone, nor
Disraeli, nor Palmerston . . . that Gladstone is certainly the
ablest man there.&nbsp; His religious opinions, in which he is
zealous and sincere, enter so largely into his political conduct
as to form a very serious obstacle to his success, for they are
abhorrent to the majority of this Protestant country, and (I was
surprised to hear him say) Graham thinks approach very nearly to
Rome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While absorbed in politics, or literature, or society, Mr.
Gladstone never forgot to do his duty to the best of his ability
as a loyal son of the Church of England.&nbsp; In 1842 there was
a fight at Oxford University on the choice of a Professor of
Poetry for the University.&nbsp; One candidate was dear to the
High Church party, the other to the Low, or Evangelical, of which
Lord Ashley was the head.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord
Sandon, urging him to entreat Lord Ashley to avoid, for the
Church&rsquo;s sake, the scandal of a contest.&nbsp; But Lord <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Ashley was on
the winning side, and his candidate was returned at the head of
the poll.</p>
<p>In 1843, in the debates on the Dissenters&rsquo; Chapel Bill,
Lord Ashley writes: &lsquo;That inexplicable Mr. Gladstone
contended that all Dissent was semi-Arian, and that a vast
proportion of the founders were, in fact,
Unitarians.&rsquo;&nbsp; When, in 1845, Mr. Ward was condemned at
Oxford for his book, &lsquo;The Ideal of a Christian
Church,&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone was one of the
<i>non-placets</i>.&nbsp; In a letter to his friend Bishop
Wilberforce in 1844, Mr. Gladstone writes: &lsquo;I rejoice to
see that you are on the whole hopeful.&nbsp; For my part, I
heartily go along with you.&nbsp; The fabric consolidates itself
more and more, even while the earthquake rocks it; for, with a
thousand drawbacks and deductions, love grows warmer and larger,
truth firmer among us.&nbsp; It makes the mind sad to speculate
on the question how much better all might have been, but our
mourning should be turned into joy and thankfulness while we
think also how much worse it might have been.&nbsp; It seems to
me to be written for our learning and use: &ldquo;He will be very
gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when He shall hear
it, He will answer thee.&nbsp; And though the Lord give you the
bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy
teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall
see thy teachers: and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee,
saying, This is the way, walk ye in it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>About this time Mr. Gladstone seems to have taken a leading
part in the establishment of the High Church College, Glenalmond,
instituted for the purpose of turning Presbyterian Scotland from
the errors of its ways.&nbsp; At that time Mr. Gladstone was
still in bondage.&nbsp; <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>He argued for the maintenance of the
Established Church in Ireland.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone had not
advanced beyond his party, and belonged to the school
immortalized in &lsquo;Tom Jones.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;When I
mention religion,&rsquo; says the Rev. Mr. Thwackum, &lsquo;I
mean the Christian religion, and not only the Christian religion,
but the Protestant religion, and not only the Protestant
religion, but the Church of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In opening the Liverpool Collegiate Institution, he pleaded
earnestly for Christian teaching.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you could erect
a system,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;which presents to man all
branches of knowledge save the one that is essential, you would
only be building up a tower of Babel, which, when you had
completed it, would be the more signal in its fall, and which
would bury those who had raised it in its ruins.&nbsp; We believe
that if you can take a human being in his youth, and make him an
accomplished man in natural philosophy, in mathematics, or in the
knowledge necessary for the profession of a merchant, a lawyer,
or a physician; that if in any or all of these endowments you
could form his mind&mdash;yes, if you could endow him with the
power and science of a Newton, and so send him forth, and if you
had concealed from him&mdash;or, rather, had not given
him&mdash;a knowledge and love of the Christian faith, he would
go forth into the world, able, indeed, with reference to those
purposes of science, successful with the accumulation of wealth
for the multiplication of more, but poor and miserable and blind
and naked with reference to everything that constitutes the true
and sovereign purpose of our existence&mdash;nay, worse with
respect to the sovereign purpose than if he had still remained in
the ignorance which we all commiserate, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>and which it
is the object of this institute to assist in removing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Gladstone was moving.&nbsp; When Lord John Russell
brought in a Bill to admit Jews to Parliament, Mr. Gladstone
supported it, though at one time against it.</p>
<p>In 1850 Mr. Gladstone wrote a letter to Bishop Hampden, which
threw a good deal of light on his mental working.&nbsp; He wrote:
&lsquo;Your lordship will probably be surprised at receiving a
letter from me.&nbsp; The simple purport of it is to discharge a
debt of the smallest possible importance to you, yet due, I
think, from me, by expressing the regret with which I now look
back on my concurrence in a vote of the University of Oxford in
the year 1836, condemnatory of some of your lordship&rsquo;s
publications.&nbsp; I did not take actual part in the vote, but,
upon reference to a journal kept at the time, I find that my
absence was owing to an accident.&nbsp; For a good many years
past I have found myself ill able to master books of an abstract
character, and I am far from presuming at this time to form a
judgment on the merits of any proposition then at issue.&nbsp; I
have learned, indeed, that many things which in the forward
precipitancy of my youth I should have condemned are either in
reality sound or lie within the just bounds of such discussion as
justly befits a University.&nbsp; But that which (after a delay
due, I think, to the cares and pressing occupations of political
life) brought back to my mind the injustice of which I had
unconsciously been guilty in 1836 was my being called upon as a
member of the Council of King&rsquo;s College in London to concur
in a measure similar in principle with respect to Mr.
Maurice&mdash;that is to say, in a condemnation <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>couched in
general terms, which really did not declare the point of imputed
guilt, and against which perfect innocence could have no
defence.&nbsp; I resisted to the best of my power, though
ineffectually, the grievous wrong done to Mr. Maurice, and urged
that the charges should be made distinct, that all the best means
of investigation should be brought to bear on them, ample
opportunity given for defence, and a reference then made, if
needful, to the Bishop in his proper capacity of layman, as the
Council were inexorable.&nbsp; It was only, as I have said, after
mature reflection that I came to perceive the bearing of the case
on that of 1836, and to find that by my resistance I had
condemned myself.&nbsp; I then lamented that on that occasion,
now so remote, I had not felt and acted in a different
manner.&nbsp; I beg your lordship to accept this, the expression
of my cordial regret.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Hampden had published
certain lectures which afterwards were strongly objected to by
the Tractarian party, whose triumph led to a good deal of
bitterness, hard to understand now.</p>
<p>Again, in March, 1865, when Mr. Dillwyn moved that &lsquo;the
present position of the Irish Church is unsatisfactory, and calls
for the earliest attention of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Government,&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone replied that they were not
prepared to deny the abstract truth of the former part of the
resolution, while they could not accept the resolution.&nbsp; The
Irish Church as she then stood was in a false position.&nbsp; She
ministered only to one eighth or one ninth of the
community.&nbsp; The debate was adjourned, and not resumed during
the remainder of the session; but the speech of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer caused <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>great excitement, and Mr. (afterwards
Chief Justice) Whiteside promptly denounced it as fatal to the
Established Church of Ireland.&nbsp; Sir Stafford Northcote
wrote: &lsquo;Gladstone made a terrible long stride in his
downward progress last night, and denounced the Irish Church in a
way that shows how by-and-by he will deal not only with it, but
the Church of England, too . . . was evidently annoyed that his
colleagues had decided on opposing Dillwyn&rsquo;s motion.&nbsp;
He laid down the doctrine that the tithes were national property.
. . .&nbsp; It is plain that he must hold that the tithe of
Wales, where the Dissenters are in a minority, does not properly
belong to the Church; and by-and-by we shall find that he will
carry the principle a great deal further.&nbsp; It is sad to see
what he is coming to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tory suspicion soon found a vent; an election was at hand, and
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s seat for Oxford University was in
danger.&nbsp; As early as 1861 the question of his retirement had
been mooted.&nbsp; In that year he wrote to the Rector of Exeter
College: &lsquo;I have never forgotten the ties which bind me to
my kind and good-natured supporters in the University, and no
prospect elsewhere could induce me to quit them, unless I could
think that at a juncture like this they might, with every
prospect of success, support a candidate who would fill my place
to their full and general satisfaction. . . .&nbsp; To quit
Oxford under any circumstances would be to me a most sad, even if
it ever became a prudent and necessary, measure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a further illustration of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Liberal
opinions, and his unfitness for Oxford, I quote from a letter of
his to Bishop Wilberforce on Mr. Hadfield&rsquo;s proposal in the
House of Commons to abolish the <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>declaration made by Mayors that they
would not use their office against the Established Church.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As I apprehend the matter, no one is obliged to take this
declaration at all.&nbsp; I took it myself last year, as Elder
Brother of the Trinity House, in which I have no duty whatever to
discharge, except, I believe, to appoint an
&ldquo;almsbody&rdquo; once in five or ten years.&nbsp; As
Chancellor of the Exchequer I have not taken it.&nbsp; An annual
Act of Indemnity passes with your consent to dispense with it,
and all who choose avail themselves of the dispensation.&nbsp; I
put it to you that this declaration ought not to be maintained
upon the Statute Book.&nbsp; If it is right to require of certain
persons that they should declare something on behalf of the
Established Church, the law, and not the individual, should
define who those persons should be.&nbsp; An established legal
<i>pr&aelig;munire</i> of self-exception is fatal to the
law.&nbsp; If you are right in saying (which I have never heard
elsewhere) that men wish to escape the declaration in order that
they may carry their municipal paraphernalia in state to
Dissenting chapels, it is plain that they can do it now, and
therefore the declaration cannot be maintained on the ground that
it prevents them, for it does not.&nbsp; If I am told that the
mere abstract existence of such a declaration, counteracted as it
is by the indemnity, deters the flesh and blood of Dissenting
Mayors from such a use of the <i>paraphernalia</i>, such a reply
appears to me fanciful.&nbsp; In short, if this Bill is not to be
supported, it appears to me better to profess thorough-going
exclusiveness at once, and to say that nothing shall be yielded
except to force, for that is what the whole matter comes to. . .
.&nbsp; It is quite obvious that if the consideration of these
measures <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>is to be approached in such a frame of mind, we shall be
doing in our day simply what Eldon and Inglis did in
theirs.&nbsp; I must say that is not my idea of my
stewardship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again, he writes to the Bishop: &lsquo;The policy of the
Church as an establishment to my mind is plain.&nbsp; She should
rest on her possessions and her powers, parting with none of
them, except for equivalents in another currency, or upon full
consideration of <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>; but outside of
these she should avoid all points of sore contact with
Dissenters.&nbsp; Each one of them is a point at which she as a
dead mass rubs upon the living flesh, and stirs the hostility of
its owner.&nbsp; It is no less due to her own interests to share
them than it is to justice as regards the Dissenter to surrender
these points&mdash;if surrender that is to be called which is so
unmixedly to her advantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1865 the Oxford University election resulted in the loss by
Mr. Gladstone of his seat.&nbsp; The opposition to him was headed
by Archdeacon Denison, on account of his conduct on the Education
Question.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone was defeated by Mr. Hardy, but he
was defeated by those members of the constituency who had the
least interest in education.&nbsp; Nearly all the professors,
tutors, and lecturers voted in the minority, but were outnumbered
by the country clergy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; writes
Bishop Wilberforce to Mr. Gladstone, &lsquo;if half of these men
had known what I know of your real devotion to our Church, that
would have outweighed their hatred to a Government which gave
Waldegrave to Carlisle, and Baring to Durham, and the youngest
Bishop on the Bench to York, and supported Westbury in denying
the faith of our Lord.&nbsp; But they could not <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>be made to
understand the truth, and have inflicted on the University and
the Church the gross indignity of rejecting the best, noblest,
and truest son of each, in order to punish
Shaftesbury&rsquo;&mdash;supposed to be Palmerston&rsquo;s
Bishop-maker&mdash;&lsquo;and Westbury.&nbsp; You were too great
for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reply was as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not conceal from yourself that my hands are very
much weakened.&nbsp; It is only as representing Oxford that a man
whose opinions are disliked and suspected could expect or could
have a title to be heard.&nbsp; I look upon myself now as a
person wholly extraneous on one great class of questions; with
respect to legislative and Cabinet measures, I am a unit.&nbsp; I
have had too much of personal collision with Westbury to be a
fair judge in his case, but in your condemnation of him as
respects attacks on Christian doctrines do not forget either what
coadjutors he has had or with what pitiful and lamentable
indifference not only the Christian public, but so many of the
clergy&mdash;so many of the warmest religionists&mdash;looked
on.&nbsp; Do not join with others in praising me because I am not
angry, only sorry, and that deeply. . . .&nbsp; There have been
two great deaths or transmigrations of spirit in my political
career&mdash;one very slow, the breaking of ties with my original
party; the other very short and sharp, the breaking of my tie
with Oxford.&nbsp; There will probably be a third, and no
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a subsequent letter Mr. Gladstone states to the Bishop his
fixed determination never to take any step to raise himself
&lsquo;to a higher level in official life; and this not on
grounds of Christian self-denial, which would hardly apply, but
on the double ground, first, of my <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>total ignorance of my capacity,
bodily or mental; and secondly, perhaps I might say specially,
because I am certain that the fact of my taking it would seal my
doom in taking it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop and Mr. Gladstone seem
ever to have been on the most confidential terms.</p>
<p>In a subsequent debate on Church rates Mr. Gladstone, while
opposing an abstract resolution on the subject, declared that he
felt as strongly as anyone the desirability of settling the
question.&nbsp; The evils attending the present system were
certainly enormous, and it was a fact that we had deviated from
the original intention of the law, which was not to oppose a mere
uncompensated burden on anyone, but a burden from which everyone
bearing it should receive a benefit, so that while each member of
the community was bound to contribute his quota to the Church,
every member of the Church was entitled to go to the
churchwardens and demand a free place to worship his Maker.&nbsp;
The case then was, especially in towns, that the centre and best
parts of the church were occupied by pews exclusively for the
middle classes, while the labouring classes were jealously
excluded from every part of sight and hearing in the churches,
and were treated in a manner which it was most painful to reflect
upon.</p>
<p>Sir George Lewis predicted that the death of Peel would have
the effect upon Gladstone of removing a weight from a spring, and
the worthy Baronet judged correctly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He will come
forward more and more, and take more part in discussion.&nbsp;
The general opinion is that Gladstone will give up his Free Trade
and become leader of the Protectionists.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was not
so; Mr. Gladstone had been a puzzle and wonder to his
contemporaries.&nbsp; It puzzled the gigantic intellect of a <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Brougham to
understand, not why Mr. Gladstone gave up office when Sir Robert
Peel proposed to increase the grant to Maynooth, but Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s explanation of his conduct.&nbsp; Mrs.
Charlotte Wynne, no superficial observer, wrote: &lsquo;Mr.
Gladstone has been given two offices to keep him quiet, by giving
him too much to do to prevent his troubling his head about the
Church; but,&rsquo; adds the lady, &lsquo;I know it will be in
vain, for to a speculative mind like his theology is a far more
inviting and extensive field than any that is offered by the
Board of Trade.&rsquo;&nbsp; This trait of his character
especially came out when he opposed the Ecclesiastical Titles
Bill, hurried through Parliament in a panic because the Pope had
given English titles to his Bishops in England.&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone ever loved to talk of theology, and in 1870 we find him
in Dr. Parker&rsquo;s pulpit in the City Temple describing
preachers&mdash;especially Dr. Newman, who, with his deep piety
and remarkable gifts of mind, he described as an object of great
interest, and Dr. Chalmers.&nbsp; Their very idiosyncrasies, Mr.
Gladstone argued, were in their favour.&nbsp; In 1870, when Mr.
Gladstone went to Mill Hill to address the scholars at the
Dissenting Grammar School there, he ended with an appeal to the
lads above all things to strive after Christian growth and
perfection.&nbsp; Early Mr. Gladstone learned to give up his
prejudices against Dissenters.&nbsp; Often has he confessed that
they are the most efficient supporters and source of
strength.&nbsp; Miss Martineau was a Dissenter, yet he went out
of his way to offer her a pension which she declined.&nbsp; To
hear Mr. Gladstone read the lessons, all the country round
flocked to Hawarden Church when the owner of the hall was at
home.&nbsp; People laughed when Lord Beaconsfield on <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>a memorable
occasion declared that he was on the side of the angels.&nbsp;
When Mr. Gladstone spoke on religious topics, people listened to
him with respect, because they felt that in all his utterances he
was sincere.&nbsp; Of his Christian liberality of sentiment we
have a further illustration when he and his son went to hear Mr.
Spurgeon, the great Baptist preacher.&nbsp; The event is thus
recorded; it took place in the beginning of the year 1882:
&lsquo;On Sunday evening last Mr. Gladstone and his eldest son
were present at the service in Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s tabernacle,
and occupied Mrs. Spurgeon&rsquo;s pew.&nbsp; Both before and
after the service these distinguished gentlemen were together in
the pastor&rsquo;s vestry.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone shook hands
heartily with the elders and deacons present, and expressed
himself highly delighted with the service.&nbsp; The visit was
strictly private, and Mr. Gladstone and his son walked back to
Downing Street.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many were the varying comments on
the event.&nbsp; In the chief Opposition paper a writer recalled
the fact that many years ago Mr. Spurgeon expressed a wish that
the Church of England might grow worse in order that she soon
might be got rid of.&nbsp; He then argued that if Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s sympathy with Mr. Spurgeon is what his presence
at the Tabernacle would imply, we have a satisfactory explanation
of the unsatisfactory character of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
ecclesiastical appointments.&nbsp; Mr. Spurgeon is a foe to the
Church; Mr. Gladstone goes to hear him, therefore he is a foe of
the Church.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, being a foe of the Church,
appoints as Bishops, Deans and Canons the men who will do the
Church most mischief.&nbsp; Of course, the <i>Saturday Review</i>
did its best to make Mr. Gladstone ridiculous in connection with
the affair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some jealousy <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>may be aroused in rival Bethels by
this announcement, which is, we believe, the first of its
kind.&nbsp; But it may possibly be that Mr. Gladstone is going to
take a course, and that he will distribute the steps of that
course equally among the various tabernacles of his stanchest
supporters.&nbsp; The battle of the Constitution is to be fought
out in the precincts of Ebenezer, and Ebenezer must be
accordingly secured.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s plan is
unquestionably a wise one.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>Saturday
Review</i> wanted to know what made Mr. Gladstone shake hands so
heartily with the deacons.&nbsp; &lsquo;A proceeding somewhat
similar to Mr. Perkes&rsquo;s plan for winning an
election.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps it is in one of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s letters to Bishop Wilberforce that we get a
clear idea of his view of the Church of England.&nbsp; In 1857 he
wrote: &lsquo;It is neither Disestablishment nor even loss of
dogmatic truth which I look upon as the greatest danger before
us, but it is the loss of those elementary principles of right
and wrong on which Christianity must itself be built.&nbsp; The
present position of the Church of England is gradually
approximating to the Erastian theory that the business of the
Establishment is to teach all sorts of doctrines, and to provide
Christian ordinances by way of comfort for all sorts of people,
to be used at their own option.&nbsp; It must become, if
uncorrected, in lapse of time a thoroughly immoral
position.&nbsp; Her case seems to be like that of
Cranmer&mdash;to be disgraced first and then burned.&nbsp; Now,
what I feel is that the constitution of the Church provides the
means of bringing controversy to issue; not means that can be
brought at all times to bear, but means that are to be
effectually, though less determinately, available for preventing
the general devastation of doctrine, either by a positive heresy
or by that <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>thesis I have named above, worse than any heresy.&nbsp;
Considering that the constitution of the Church with respect to
doctrine is gradually growing into an offence to the moral sense
of mankind, and that the question is, Shall we get, if we can,
the means of giving expression to that mind? I confess that I
cannot be repelled by fears connected with the state of the
Episcopal Bench from saying Yes.&nbsp; Let me have it if I can,
for, regarding the Church as a privileged and endowed body, no
less than one with spiritual prerogatives, I feel these two
things&mdash;if the mind of those who rule and of those who
compose the Church is deliberately anti-Catholic, I have no right
to seek a hiding place within the pale of her possessions by
keeping her in a condition of voicelessness in which all are
entitled to be there because none are.&nbsp; That is, viewing her
with respect to the enjoyment of her temporal advantages,
spiritually how can her life be saved by stopping her from the
exercise of functions essential to her condition?&nbsp; It may be
said she is sick; wait till she is well.&nbsp; My answer is, She
is getting more and more sick in regard to her own function of
authoritatively declaring the truth; let us see whether her being
called upon so to declare it may not be the remedy, or a remedy,
at least.&nbsp; I feel certain that the want of combined and
responsible ecclesiastical action is one of the main evils, and
that the regular duty of such action will tend to check the
spirit of individualism and to restore that belief in a Church we
have almost lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of colonial Bishops Mr. Gladstone had a high admiration.&nbsp;
In 1876 he wrote: &lsquo;It is indeed, I fear, true that a
part&mdash;not the whole&mdash;of our colonial episcopate have
sunk below the level established for <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>it five-and-thirty years ago by the
Bishops of those days.&nbsp; But how high a level it was! and how
it lifted the entire heart of the Church of England!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here it is as well to give some further particulars as to Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s action with regard to Church matters.&nbsp; In
1836 Mr. Gladstone left the Church Pastoral Aid Society, of which
he had become one of the vice-presidents, in consequence of an
attempt to introduce lay agency.&nbsp; At all times he was ready
to guard and vindicate the religious character of his alma
mater.&nbsp; On one occasion Lord Palmerston had expressed a
reasonable dislike of a system which compelled the undergraduates
&lsquo;to go from wine to prayers, and from prayers to
wine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, in reply, said he had a better
opinion of the undergraduates who had been so lately his
companions.&nbsp; He did not believe that even in their most
convivial moments they were unfit to enter the house of
prayer.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone was one of a committee which met at
the lodgings of Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas) Acland in Jermyn
Street, which led to the formation of Boards of Education for the
different dioceses, and to the establishment of training
colleges, with the double aim of securing religious education for
the middle classes and the collegiate education of the
schoolmasters.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s ecclesiastical leanings soon brought him
back to Parliamentary life, in connection with Archbishop
Tait&rsquo;s Public Worship Regulation Bill.&nbsp; The grounds of
his opposition he affirmed in the following resolutions:</p>
<p>&lsquo;1.&nbsp; That in proceeding to consider the grounds for
the Regulation of Public Worship this House cannot do otherwise
than take into view the lapse of more <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>than two centuries since the
enactment of the present rubrics of the Common Prayer-Book of the
Church of England; the multitude of particulars combined in the
conduct of Divine service under their provisions; the doubt
occasionally attaching to their interpretation, and the number of
points they are thought to have left undecided; the diversities
of local custom which under these circumstances have long
prevailed; and the unreasonableness of proscribing all varieties
of opinion and usage among the many thousands of congregations of
the Church distributed throughout the land.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2.&nbsp; That this House is therefore reluctant to
place in the hands of any single Bishop&mdash;on the motion of
one or more persons, however defined&mdash;greatly increased
facilities towards procuring an absolute ruling of many points
hitherto left open and reasonably allowing of diversity, and
thereby enforcing the establishment of an inflexible rule of
uniformity throughout the land, to the prejudice in matters
indifferent of the liberty now practically existing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3.&nbsp; That the House willingly acknowledges the
great and exemplary devotion of the clergy in general to their
sacred calling, but is not on that account the less disposed to
guard against the indiscretions or thirst for power of other
individuals.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4.&nbsp; That this House is therefore willing to lend
its best assistance to any measure recommended by adequate
authority, with a view to provide more effectual security against
any neglect of, or departure from, strict law which may give
evidence of a design to alter, without the consent of the nation,
the spirit or the substance of revealed religion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5.&nbsp; That in the opinion of this House it is also
to be <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>desired that the members of the Church having a
legitimate interest in her services should receive ample
protection against precipitate and arbitrary changes of
established customs by the sole will of the clergyman and against
the wishes locally prevalent amongst them, and that such
protection does not appear to be afforded by the provisions of
the Bill now before the House.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6.&nbsp; That the House attaches a high value to the
concurrence of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government with the
ecclesiastical authorities in the initiative of legislation
affecting the Established Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In moving these resolutions, Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s speech was
of the highest interest and importance; &lsquo;but never,
perhaps, in his long career,&rsquo; writes the biographer of
Archbishop Tait, &lsquo;did his eloquence so completely fail to
enlist the sympathy even of his own supporters, and the
resolutions were withdrawn.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bill, opposed by Dr.
Pusey on one side and Lord Shaftesbury on the other, was carried
in a modified form.&nbsp; Eye-witnesses have described the debate
on the second reading: &lsquo;The House, jaded with a long and
anxious sitting, was eager to divide.&nbsp; A clear voice was
heard above the clamour.&nbsp; It was Mr. Hussey Vivian, an old
and tried friend of Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; He rose to warn him not
to persist in his amendments; not twenty men on his own side of
the House would follow him into the Lobby.&nbsp; Already deft
lieutenants, mournful of aspect, had brought slips of paper to
their chief, fraught, it seemed, with no good tidings.&nbsp; When
the Speaker put the question, there was no challenge for a
division.&nbsp; Amid a roar of mixed cheers and laughter, the six
resolutions melted away into darkness.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Sir
William Harcourt was one of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s principal
opponents in the course of the debate.&nbsp; In Committee there
was rather an amusing passage of arms between Mr. Gladstone and
his old Attorney-General.&nbsp; Sir William espoused the Bill
strongly, and implored Mr. Disraeli to come to the rescue.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We have,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;a leader of the House who
is proud of the House of Commons, and of whom the House of
Commons is proud.&rsquo;&nbsp; A provision had been introduced
into the Bill which would have overthrown the Bishops&rsquo;
right of veto on proceedings to be instituted in the New
Court.&nbsp; This provision Mr. Gladstone vehemently opposed, and
quoted from the canonist Van Espero.&nbsp; Sir William ridiculed
the quotations, and accused Mr. Gladstone at the eleventh hour of
having come back to wreck the Bill.&nbsp; Two days after he again
attacked Mr. Gladstone, and quoted authorities in support of his
views.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reply was complete.</p>
<p>At this time Mr. Gladstone was much occupied with his
favourite ecclesiastical subjects.&nbsp; In an article on
&lsquo;Ritual and Ritualism,&rsquo; contributed to the
<i>Contemporary Review</i>, he contended for the lawfulness and
expediency of moderate ritual in the services of the Church of
England.&nbsp; He returned to Church questions in a second
article entitled &lsquo;Is the Church of England worth
Preserving?&rsquo;&mdash;a question which, of course, he answered
in the affirmative.&nbsp; In the course of his remarks he created
a perfect storm of indignation on the part of the Roman
Catholics.&nbsp; To meet this Mr. Gladstone published a pamphlet
called &lsquo;The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil
Allegiance.&rsquo;&nbsp; One hundred and twenty thousand copies
of the pamphlet were sold in a few weeks, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and the press
was filled with replies.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone returned to the
charge in a pamphlet entitled &lsquo;Vaticanism,&rsquo; in which
he contended that in theory the Papal Infallibility was
inconsistent with the requirements of civil allegiance.&nbsp; In
connection with this subject, let it be briefly stated that in
1880, when Mr. Gladstone returned to power, one of the first
things to be settled was the Dissenters&rsquo; Burial Bill, a
subject first brought before the House of Commons by Sir Morton
Peto in 1861.&nbsp; The Bill was finally piloted through the
House of Commons by Mr. Osborne Morgan, Judge Advocate.&nbsp;
Perhaps by this time Mr. Gladstone had become tired of
ecclesiastical difficulties.&nbsp; In a letter to the Lord
Chancellor respecting fresh legislation on the part of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr. Gladstone wrote: &lsquo;The thing
certainly could not be done by the authority of the Cabinet, were
the Cabinet disposed to use it, of which at present I can say
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>About this time a church was built at Stroud Green, near
Finsbury Park, at a cost of &pound;11,000, &pound;8,000 of which
was contributed by the parishioners and their friends.&nbsp; It
was an Evangelical or Low church, but when, on the
incumbent&rsquo;s retirement, Mr. Gladstone, claiming the
presentation on behalf of the Crown, thought fit to appoint as
Vicar a clergyman whose antecedents proved him to be commonly
known as ritualistic, the parishioners protested.&nbsp; Petitions
against Mr. Linklater&rsquo;s appointment, signed by 2,300
petitioners and members of the congregation, were presented to
Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; The following is a quotation from a letter
written by the late Vicar: &lsquo;There is a very widespread
anxiety through the congregation that the church which their
money <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>has
built should not pass into the hands of one who does not hold the
same Evangelical views, or favour the same simple ritual to which
they have been accustomed.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop also appealed
and remonstrated; all was in vain.&nbsp; On August 23, 1885, Mr.
Linklater was inducted to the charge of the parish.&nbsp; A
majority of the seat-holders at once relinquished their seats;
others, we are told, have since followed their example, and some
who remained in hope of better things are obliged to acknowledge
that their hopes are disappointed.&nbsp; The services most prized
by the congregation have been discontinued, and other services
introduced which are believed to be unscriptural, contrary to the
laws ecclesiastical, and opposed to the plain directions of the
Book of Common Prayer.</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. GLADSTONE AND THE DIVORCE
BILL.</span></h2>
<p>In 1857 there occurred a memorable passage of arms between Mr.
Gladstone and Sir Richard Bethell&mdash;afterwards Lord
Westbury&mdash;on the subject of divorce.&nbsp; More than one
Commission had reported in favour of establishing a separate
court, so that the dissolution of marriage might be effected by
judicial separation instead of a special Act of Parliament.&nbsp;
By this change the expense incident to the existing procedure
would be materially reduced, and the remedy which lay within the
reach of the wealthy would be extended to the poor.&nbsp; As the
law stood, the privilege of obtaining a relief from the marriage
tie depended on a mere property qualification.&nbsp; If a man had
&pound;1,000 to spend, he might rid himself of an unfaithful
wife; if not, he must remain her husband.</p>
<p>The absurdity of the law was well put by Mr. Justice
Maule.&nbsp; A hawker who had been convicted of bigamy urged in
extenuation that his wife had been unfaithful to him and deserted
him, and that was why he had to take a second wife.&nbsp; In
passing sentence, the judge, addressing the prisoner, said:
&lsquo;I will tell you what you ought to have done under the
circumstances, and if you say you did not know, I must tell you
that the law <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>conclusively presumes you did.&nbsp; You should have
instructed your attorney to bring an action against the seducer
of your wife for damages; that would have cost you about
&pound;100.&nbsp; Having succeeded thus far, you should have
employed a proctor, and instituted a suit in the Ecclesiastical
Court for a divorce <i>a mens&acirc; et thoro</i>; that would
have cost you &pound;200 or &pound;300 more.&nbsp; When you had
obtained a divorce <i>a mens&acirc; et thoro</i>, you had only to
obtain a private Act for a divorce <i>a vinculo
matrimonii</i>.&nbsp; The Bill might possibly have been opposed
in all its stages in both Houses of Parliament, and altogether
these proceedings would have cost you &pound;1,000.&nbsp; You
will probably tell me that you never had a tenth of that sum, but
that makes no difference.&nbsp; Sitting here as an English judge,
it is my duty to tell you that this is not a country in which
there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.&nbsp; You
will be imprisoned for one day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The long-postponed Bill was introduced into the Lords, where
it passed after unflagging opposition from Bishop
Wilberforce.&nbsp; July 24 was the date fixed for its second
reading in the House of Commons, but no sooner had the
Attorney-General (Bethell) risen to explain the Bill than Mr.
Henley interposed with a motion that it be read again in a
month.&nbsp; He was supported in this unusual proceeding in a
speech of great length and energy by Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; The
motion was negatived by a large majority.&nbsp; On July 30 the
Attorney-General made his proposed statement.&nbsp; In the course
of his speech he pointedly alluded to Mr. Gladstone as a great
master of eloquence and subtle reasoning.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that
right hon. gentleman had lived&mdash;thank Heaven he had
not&mdash;in the Middle Ages, when invention was racked to <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>find terms of
eulogium for the <i>subtilissimi doctores</i>, how great would
have been his reputation!&rsquo;&nbsp; The case against the Bill
was presented with the most telling force by Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp;
He began by urging the strong feeling against the Bill, and the
great danger of precipitancy on legislating in such a House under
Government pressure.&nbsp; The Bill undertook to deal not only
with the civil consequences and responsibilities of marriage, but
also to determine religious obligations and to cancel the most
solemn vows; while, though not invested with any theological
authority, it set itself up as a square and measure of the
consciences of men.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must confess,&rsquo; continued
Mr. Gladstone, &lsquo;that there is no legend, there is no
fiction, there is no speculation, however wild, that I should not
deem it rational to admit into my mind rather than allow what I
conceive to be one of the most degrading doctrines that can be
propounded to civilized men&mdash;namely, that the Legislature
has power to absolve a man from spiritual vows taken before
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone met the assertion that the Bill
made no change in the law, but merely reduced to legislative form
what had long had legislative effect, by a direct negative.&nbsp;
The Bill carried divorce to the door of all men of all classes,
and was therefore to all intents as completely novel as if it had
no Parliamentary precedent.&nbsp; Entering upon the theological
arguments under protest, as a discussion which could not properly
be conducted in a popular assembly, he adduced much historical
testimony, particularly that of the Primitive Christian Church,
to refute the propositions of the Attorney-General as to the
solubility of marriage.&nbsp; Coming down to the Reformation, Mr.
Gladstone forcibly summarized Sir Richard Bethell&rsquo;s <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>argument,
turning aside for a moment to interpolate an amusing personal
reference:</p>
<p>&lsquo;While I am mentioning my honourable and learned friend,
it would be ungrateful in me not to take notice of the
undeservedly kind language in which he thanked Heaven that I had
not lived and died in the Middle Ages.&nbsp; My hon. and learned
friend complimented me on the subtlety of my understanding, and
it is a compliment of which I feel the more the force since it
comes from a gentleman who possesses such a plain,
straightforward, John-Bull-like character of
mind&mdash;<i>rusticus abnormis sapiens crassaque
Minerve</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, and by the force of contrast, I
feel the compliment to be ten times more valuable.&nbsp; But I
must say, if I am guilty of that subtlety of mind of which he
accuses me, I think that there is no one cause in the history of
my life to which it can be so properly attributed as to my having
been for two or three pleasant years the colleague and
co-operator with my hon. and learned friend.&nbsp; And if there
was a class of those <i>subtilissimi doctores</i> which was open
to competition, and if I were a candidate for admission and heard
that my hon. and learned friend was so likewise, I assure him
that I would not stand against him on any account
whatever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s next sally was received with much
applause.&nbsp; He contended that the Attorney-General had
surpassed himself in liberality, for he gave a ninth beatitude:
&lsquo;Blessed is the man who trusts the received
version&rsquo;&mdash;a doctrine much more in keeping with the
Middle Ages and those <i>subtilissimi doctores</i> than with the
opinion of an Attorney-General of a Liberal Government in the
nineteenth century; that was, Blessed is he who shuts his eyes,
and does not attempt to <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>discover historical truth; who
discards the aims of legitimate criticism; who, in order to save
himself trouble and pass an important Bill without exertion,
determines not to make use of the faculties that God has given
him, and throws discredit upon scholarship and upon the
University of which he is a conspicuous ornament, by refusing to
recognise anything but the received version.&nbsp; Referring to
the social aspect of the question, Mr. Gladstone with glowing
eloquence deplored the change which the Bill would work in the
marriage state, as shaking the great idea of the marriage
ceremony in the minds of the people, marking the first stage on a
road of which they knew nothing, except that it was different
from that of their forefathers, and carried them back towards the
state in which Christianity found the heathenism of man.&nbsp; In
conclusion, he declared that he resisted the measure because it
offended his own conscientious feelings; it was a retrograde
step, pregnant with the most dangerous consequences to their
social interests; it was not desired by the people of this
country; it contained a proposal harsh and unjust towards the
ministers of religion, and involved an insult to religion itself;
and, lastly, because it was brought forward at a time when it was
impossible to bring the mind of the country and the House to an
adequate consideration of its magnitude and importance.&nbsp;
Although he might be entirely powerless in arresting its
progress, he was determined, as far as it depended upon him, that
he would be responsible for no part of the consequences of a
measure fraught, as he believed it to be, with danger to the
highest interests of religion and the morality of the
people.&nbsp; The speech held the House spellbound, and its
conclusion was greeted by prolonged cheering.&nbsp; It <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>was felt that
all that could be said against the measure had been said.&nbsp;
After a forcible reply from Sir Richard Bethell, in which he
addressed himself exclusively to the argument of Mr. Gladstone,
who had, he said, on that occasion transcended himself, and, like
Aaron&rsquo;s rod, swallowed up all the rest of the opponents of
the Bill, the second reading was carried by a majority of
111.&nbsp; It was time Mr. Gladstone exerted himself; he had lost
ground last session as being unpractical.</p>
<p>In the October of that year Bishop Wilberforce was at
Hawarden, and had much talk with Gladstone.&nbsp; He said:
&lsquo;I greatly feel being turned out of office.&nbsp; I saw
great things to do; I longed to do them.&nbsp; I am losing the
best years of my life out of my natural service, yet I have never
ceased to rejoice that I am not in office with Palmerston.&nbsp;
When I have seen the tricks, the shufflings, he daily has
recourse to, as to his business, I rejoice not to sit on the
Treasury Bench with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the Divorce Bill intensified his dislike to the
Palmerston regime.&nbsp; Never was there a severer fight than
that which took place in Committee.&nbsp; Clause by clause, line
by line, almost word by word, the progress of the measure was
challenged by an acute and determined opposition.&nbsp; One of
the most important amendments was made by Lord John Manners, to
give jurisdiction to local courts in cases of judicial
separation.&nbsp; A still more important amendment was proposed
with the object of extending to the wife the same right of
divorce as was given to the husband.&nbsp; On this proposal Mr.
Gladstone made a telling speech, founding his argument on the
equality of the sexes in the highest relations of life.&nbsp; A
further amendment in the same direction was attacked with such
ardour by Mr. Gladstone, <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Lord John Manners, and Mr. Henly,
that at length the Attorney-General claimed the right, as having
official charge of the Bill, to be treated with some
consideration, and then he carried the war into the enemy&rsquo;s
country so as to bring Mr. Gladstone again to his feet.&nbsp; He
complained bitterly of Sir Richard Bethell&rsquo;s charges of
inconsistency and insincerity&mdash;&lsquo;charges which,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;have not only proceeded from his mouth, but
gleamed from those eloquent eyes of his which have turned
continuously on me for the last ten minutes.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
commented severely on the Attorney-General&rsquo;s statement of
his duty with regard to the Bill.&nbsp; It was pushed by him
through the House as a Ministerial duty; he received it from the
Cabinet, for whom he considered it his duty to hew wood and draw
water.&nbsp; In the course of the discussion of this clause,
which occupied ten hours, Mr. Gladstone made upwards of twenty
speeches, some of them of considerable length.&nbsp; He was on
his legs every three minutes, in a white heat of
excitement.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone is stated to have told Lord
Palmerston that the Bill should not be carried till the Greek
Calends, and in reply to the question put to him in the lobby by
Sir Richard Bethell&mdash;&lsquo;Is it to be peace or
war?&rsquo;&mdash;fiercely replied, &lsquo;War, Mr.
Attorney&mdash;war even to the knife.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gladstone,&rsquo; he wrote to his wife, &lsquo;gives a
personal character to the debates.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s amendments&mdash;to the effect that clergymen
having conscientious objections to remarrying of divorced persons
were to be exempt from any penalty for refusing to solemnize such
marriages&mdash;which he was unable to move on account of a
domestic calamity, was put forward by Sir W. Heathcote and
accepted by the Government, and the long and bitter battle came
to an end on <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>August 31, when the third reading passed without a
division.</p>
<p>Writing as late as 1887, Mr. Gladstone contends that the
Divorce Bill was an error.&nbsp; &lsquo;My objection,&rsquo;
writes Mr. Gladstone, &lsquo;to the Divorce Bill was very greatly
sharpened by its introduction of the principle of
inequality.&nbsp; But there is behind this the fact that I have
no belief whatever in the operation of Parliamentary enactments
upon a vow&mdash;a case which appears to me wholly different from
that of the Coronation Oath.&nbsp; I think it would have been
better to attempt civil legislation only, as in the case of the
Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister Bill.&nbsp; Lord Westbury and I were
pitted in conflict by the Divorce Bill; but he was the
representative of a prevailing public opinion, as well as of an
Administration&mdash;I of an opinion which had become isolated
and unpopular.&nbsp; I remember hearing with some consolation
from Lord Wensleydale that he was against the principle of the
Bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is but fair to add that, after the Act had
passed, Mr. Gladstone, with the generous frankness which
distinguishes all great men, wrote a letter to the
Attorney-General, expressing regret for any language he had used
during debates on the Bill which might have given pain.&nbsp; Sir
Richard used to say during the course of the debates that Mr.
Gladstone was the only debater in the House of Commons whose
subtlety of intellect and didactic skill made it a pleasure to
cross swords with him.</p>
<h2><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">POLITICS AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>When Parliament met in 1859, an amendment was moved to the
Address in a maiden speech from Lord Hartington, which was
carried after a three nights&rsquo; debate, Mr. Gladstone voting
with the Government.&nbsp; Lord Derby and his colleagues
instantly resigned.&nbsp; A new Government was formed&mdash;Lord
Palmerston Premier, Lord John Russell leader of the House of
Commons, with Mr. Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp;
A spirited opposition to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s re-election for
the University took place.&nbsp; Lord Chandos&mdash;afterwards
the Duke of Buckingham&mdash;came forward as the Conservative
candidate.&nbsp; In an address put forward on his behalf by
Professor Mansel, it was stated: &lsquo;By his acceptance of
office Mr. Gladstone must now be considered as having given his
adherence to the Liberal party as at present reconstructed, and
as approving of the policy of those who overthrew Lord
Derby&rsquo;s Government at the late division.&nbsp; By his vote
on that division Mr. Gladstone expressed his confidence in the
Administration of Lord Derby.&nbsp; By accepting office he now
expresses his confidence in the administration of Lord
Derby&rsquo;s opponent and successor.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>letter to Dr.
Hawkins, the Provost of Oriel, Mr. Gladstone wrote:
&lsquo;Various differences of opinion, both on foreign and
domestic matters, separated me during great part of the
Administration of Lord Palmerston from a body of men with the
majority of whom I had acted in perfect harmony under Lord
Aberdeen.&nbsp; I promoted the vote of the House of Commons,
which in February led to the downfall of that Ministry.&nbsp;
Such having been the case, I thought it my clear duty to support,
as far as I was able, the Government of Lord Derby.&nbsp;
Accordingly, on the various occasions during the existence of the
late Parliament when they were seriously threatened with danger
of embarrassment, I found myself, like many other independent
members, lending them such assistance as was in my
power.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Oxford election terminated in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
triumph over his opponent.&nbsp; It is curious to note how
entirely Mr. Gladstone concurred with Lord John Russell.&nbsp; He
worked hard in the Cabinet and in Parliament for his
lordship&rsquo;s Reform Bill, and regarded with aversion Lord
Palmerston&rsquo;s fortifications.&nbsp; In a letter to Her
Majesty we read: &lsquo;Viscount Palmerston hopes to be able to
overcome his objections, but if that should prove impossible,
however great the loss to the Government by the retirement of Mr.
Gladstone, it would be better to lose Mr. Gladstone than to run
the risk of losing Portsmouth or Plymouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; When his
colleague&rsquo;s scruples had been overcome, Lord Palmerston
wrote to his Sovereign: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone told Lord Palmerston
this evening that he wished it to be understood that, though
acquiescing in the step now taken about the fortifications, he
kept himself free to take such course as he might think fit upon
the subject next year; to which <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Lord Palmerston consented.&nbsp; That
course will probably be the same which Mr. Gladstone took last
year&mdash;namely, ineffectual opposition and ultimate
acquiescence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gavan Duffy has given us a correct picture of Gladstone as
he appeared to him about this time: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone was not
yet the official leader of the Peelites, but he was the most
noteworthy of them, and attracted close observation.&nbsp; He was
habitually grave, it seemed to me, and spoke as if he uttered
oracles; yet he left the impression that his speeches were not
only improvised, but that the process of adopting a conclusion
was not always complete when he rose to speak.&nbsp; But the
vigour and grace of his rhetoric put criticism to flight.&nbsp;
The House, which relished the persiflage of Palmerston, thought
Gladstone too serious, and resented a little, I think, the
subdued tone of contemptuous superiority in which he addressed
the leader of the House.&nbsp; He was as smooth as silk, but
there was manifestly a reserve of vehement and angry passion
ready to break out when it was provoked.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a book just published by Mr. Hogan we get a glance at Mr.
Gladstone as Colonial Secretary.&nbsp; In Queensland a town still
bears his name.&nbsp; The town of Gladstone, which is now within
the limits of North Queensland, has been somewhat overshadowed by
Rockhampton, which owes its existence to the gold fever which, at
the time when folk began to talk of &lsquo;North
Australia,&rsquo; nobody foresaw.&nbsp; The period, indeed, seems
to us now curiously remote, though it is still fresh in the mind
of the statesman whose name was bestowed upon the capital of the
intended new colony.&nbsp; So much, at least, appears from the
prefatory note addressed to the author:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Hogan</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;My recollections of &ldquo;Gladstone&rdquo; were most
copious, and are now nearly half a century old.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The period, December, 1845, when I became Colonial
Secretary, was one when the British Government had begun to feel
nonplussed by the question of Transportation.&nbsp; Under the
pressure of this difficulty, Lord Stanley, or the Colonial Office
of his day, framed a plan for the establishment, as an
experiment, of a pure penal colony without free settlers (at
least, at the outset).</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I came in, the plan might have been arrested in
the event of disapproval; but the Government were, I think,
committed, and I had only to put the last hand to the scheme.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it went on towards execution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In July, 1846, the Government was changed, and Lord
Grey succeeded me.&nbsp; He said he would make none but necessary
changes in pending measures.&nbsp; He, however, annihilated this
scheme.&nbsp; For that I do not know that he is to be severely
blamed.&nbsp; But he went on and dealt with the question in such
a way as to produce a mess&mdash;I think more than one&mdash;far
worse than any that he found.&nbsp; The result was the total and
rather violent and summary extinction of the entire system.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here I lost sight of the fate of
&ldquo;Gladstone.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has my good wishes, but I have
nothing else to give.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours very faithful,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">W. E.
Gladstone</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Hogan deals with the decline and fall of
transportation.&nbsp; It had ceased in New South Wales before Mr.
Gladstone came into office.&nbsp; It had broken down <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>also in
Norfolk Island, and the hideous practice in Van Diemen&rsquo;s
Land, known as &lsquo;the probation system,&rsquo; was causing
considerable excitement.&nbsp; It was at this time that Lord
Stanley conceived the notion of a new penal colony in North
Australia, and it fell to his successor, Mr. Gladstone, to give
it form and substance.&nbsp; Mr. Hogan does not spare Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s political errors; he is, on the contrary,
rather given to dwelling upon them with an acerbity which is to
be regretted.&nbsp; We all know that the venerable statesman, who
has now well-nigh outlived the bitterness of party rancour, had
in those days much to learn.&nbsp; He was undoubtedly, at one
time, of opinion that the right of the mother country to found
penal settlements at the Antipodes was incontestable; but this
view was then shared by most politicians outside the thoughtful
circle of the Philosophical Radicals.&nbsp; It is clear,
moreover, that Mr. Gladstone came to the subject of
transportation with a sincere conviction that it was possible to
convert criminals into good citizens, whose presence on the soil
would be, not a curse, but an advantage.&nbsp; There is a
remarkable State paper in the shape of a memorandum addressed to
Sir Eardley Wilmot, who had been sent out specially to inaugurate
the probation system.&nbsp; In this, after commenting with the
enthusiasm natural to a young statesman on the practicability of
reformation, he goes on to say: &lsquo;Considerations yet more
sacred enhance the importance of it, for it is impossible to
forget in how large a proportion of cases these unhappy people
have every claim on our sympathy which the force of temptation,
adverse circumstances of life, ignorance and neglected education,
can afford to those who have incurred the penalty of the
law.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>But our
colonists, no doubt, saw in such utterances only a pharisaism
which overlooks the fact that this is pre-eminently a sort of
charity which should begin at home.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, as
appears from his despatches, was profoundly dissatisfied with the
way in which Sir Eardley Wilmot&mdash;who was an old man, with
probably an old-fashioned aversion to new ideas&mdash;performed,
or, rather, did not perform, his duties, and finally dismissed
him.&nbsp; Unfortunately, at the same time he addressed him in a
private or &lsquo;secret&rsquo; letter, in which he referred to
certain rumours that had reached him of irregularities in Sir
Eardley&rsquo;s private life, which, as they were subsequently
disproved, and Sir Eardley died during the controversy, awakened
much sympathy.&nbsp; Mr. Hogan gives great prominence to this old
scandal, and there can be no doubt that Sir Eardley was unjustly
treated; but it is manifest that it was not the malicious
rumours, but the neglect of duty, that was the ground of his
dismissal.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s complaint is:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have under your charge and responsibility many
thousand convicts formed into probation parties, or living
together at Government depots.&nbsp; It is only with extreme
rarity that you advert in your despatches to the moral condition
of these men.&nbsp; You have discussed the economical questions
connected with their maintenance or their coercion, and you have
even entered into argument, though in a manner too little
penetrating, upon their offences against the laws.&nbsp; But into
the inner world of their mental, moral and spiritual state,
either you have not made it a part of your duty to examine, or
else&mdash;which for the present issue is, I apprehend,
conclusive&mdash;you have not placed Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Government in possession of the results.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>It is
curious to note Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s unpopularity in the
Colonies.&nbsp; When Sir Henry Parkes, the New South Wales
Premier, visited England, he writes: &lsquo;I had a long
conversation with Mr. Gladstone, in the course of which I told
him that he had been often charged in Australia, both in the
newspapers and in speeches, with being indifferent, if not
inimical, to the preservation of the connection between the
colonies and England.&nbsp; He was visibly surprised at what I
told him, and said I was authorized to say that he had never at
any time favoured such view, and that I might challenge any
person making the charge to produce proof in support of
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another occasion Sir Henry Parkes writes:
&lsquo;We talked for two hours chiefly on Australian topics, and
I recollect very vividly his animated inquiry as to whether many
of the young men of the country entered the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Budget of 1860 was distinguished mainly for two
things&mdash;the Commercial Treaty with France, initiated by Mr.
Cobden, and the Taxes on Knowledge.</p>
<p>In the debate on this subject in 1852, Mr. Gladstone, then in
opposition, intimated that, though he should like to see the
paper duty repealed when the proper time had come, if books and
newspapers were dearer than they ought to be, the blame was not
so much with fiscal requirements as with the trades unionism,
which wickedly raised the wages of compositors and others to a
level far above their deserts.&nbsp; If the working-classes
wanted cheap literature, he thought that they had a sufficient
remedy in their own hands, as they themselves could cheapen the
labour by which the literature was produced (quoted from Fox
Bourne&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of the Newspaper Press&rsquo;).</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>In the
following year Mr. Gladstone, after the Government had been
beaten, as a compromise, proposed to reduce the advertisement
duty from one shilling and sixpence to sixpence.&nbsp; But he was
again defeated, and the tax, in spite of him, was abolished
altogether.&nbsp; The final stage was reached in 1861, when the
paper duty was abolished, Mr. Gladstone being Chancellor of the
Exchequer, after the Bill had been defeated in the House of
Lords.&nbsp; &lsquo;It entailed,&rsquo; wrote Mr. Gladstone in
the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, &lsquo;the severest Parliamentary
struggle in which I have ever been engaged.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
repeal of the paper duty was the arrival of a new era in
literature&mdash;of the penny newspaper, of the popular magazine,
of cheap reprints of all our great standard authors.</p>
<p>On February 15 Mr. Greville writes: &lsquo;When I left London
a fortnight ago the world was anxiously expecting
Gladstone&rsquo;s speech, in which he was to put the Commercial
Treaty and the Budget before the world.&nbsp; His own confidence,
and that of most of his colleagues, in his success was unbounded,
but many inveighed bitterly against the treaty.&nbsp; Clarendon
shook his head, Overstone pronounced against the treaty, the
<i>Times</i> thundered against it, and there is little doubt that
it was unpopular, and becoming more so every day.&nbsp; Then came
Gladstone&rsquo;s unlucky illness, which compelled him to put off
his expose, and made it doubtful whether he would not be
physically disabled from doing justice to the subject.&nbsp; His
doctor says he ought to have taken two months&rsquo; rest instead
of two days.&nbsp; However, at the end of his two days&rsquo;
delay he came forth and, <i>consensus omnium</i>, achieved one of
the greatest triumphs that the House of Commons ever <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>witnessed.&nbsp; Everybody, I have heard from home,
admits that it was a magnificent display, not to be surpassed in
ability of execution, and that he carried the House of Commons
with him.&nbsp; I can well believe it, for when I read the report
of it next day it carried me along with it likewise.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The only parties not gratified were the Temperance Reformers, who
did not like the cheap Gladstone claret which was immediately
introduced at the dinner-tables, nor that clause of the new Bill
which was to give grocers licenses to sell the cheap wines of
France, and which was to make the fortune of the great house of
Gilbey.</p>
<p>Lord Russell became a peer, and left Mr. Gladstone to fight
the good fight in the House of Commons, about this time.&nbsp;
Gladstone and Disraeli were fully recognised as the leaders of
their respective parties.&nbsp; In the life of Mr. Richard
Redgrave, under the date of 1860, Mr. Redgrave gives a
description of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reply to Mr.
Disraeli&rsquo;s attack on the French Treaty.&nbsp; A friend who
was present told him: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone was in such a state of
excitement that everyone dreaded an attack from him; that his
punishment of Mr. Disraeli was most ferocious.&nbsp; He was like
a Cherokee Indian fighting; he first knocked down his adversary,
then he stamped upon him, then he got excited and danced on him;
he scalped him, and then took him between his finger and thumb
like a miserable insect, and looked at him, and held him up to
contempt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Macarthy&rsquo;s judicious criticism may be quoted
here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is idle to contend that between Gladstone and
Disraeli any love was lost, and that many people thought it was
unhandsome on the part of Mr. Gladstone <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>not to attend
his great rival&rsquo;s obsequies, and to bury his animosities in
the grave.&nbsp; In 1862 Disraeli complained to the Bishop of
Oxford that he and others kept the Church as Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s nest-egg when he became a Whig till it was
almost addled.&nbsp; At this time Disraeli wrote: &ldquo;I wish
you could have induced Gladstone to have joined Lord
Derby&rsquo;s Government when Lord Ellenborough resigned in
1858.&nbsp; It was not my fault that he did not; I almost went on
my knees to him.&nbsp; Had he done so, the Church and everything
else would have been in a very different position.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1867 the Bishop of Oxford writes: &ldquo;The most wonderful
thing is the rise of Disraeli.&nbsp; It is not the mere assertion
of talent, as you hear so many say; it seems to me quite beside
that.&nbsp; He has been able to teach the House of Commons almost
to ignore Gladstone, and at present lords it over him, and, I am
told, says that he will hold him down for twenty
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Disraeli, however, did himself no good when,
in 1878, he described Mr. Gladstone as a sophistical rhetorician,
inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity, and gifted
with an egotistical imagination that at all times can command an
interminable and inconsistent series of arguments to malign his
opponents and to glorify himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Disraeli was never happy in statement.&nbsp; When he had to
explain a policy, financial or other, he might really be regarded
as a very dull speaker.&nbsp; Gladstone was specially brilliant
in statement.&nbsp; He could give to an exposition of figures the
fascination of a romance or a poem.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone never
could, under any circumstances, be a dull speaker.&nbsp; He was
no equal of Disraeli in the gift of sarcasm, and what Disraeli
himself called &lsquo;flouts and jeers.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in his
reply he swept his <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>antagonist before him with his marvellous eloquence,
compounded of reason and passion.</p>
<p>On the breaking out of the American Civil War, Mr. Gladstone
was undoubtedly on the side of the South: Jefferson Davis, he
said, had made a nation of the South&mdash;a speech of which Mr.
Gladstone repented a few years after.&nbsp; But it took a long
time for the North to forgive or forget his unfortunate
speech.&nbsp; Bishop Fraser, writing in 1865, says: &lsquo;They
have just got hold of about a dozen subscribers to the
Confederate Loan, among whom is W. E. Gladstone, down, to my
surprise, for &pound;2,000.&nbsp; This, as you might expect, is a
topic for excited editorials, and the cry is that the American
Government ought to demand his dismissal from the
Ministry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In time the Americans began to understand Mr. Gladstone
better, and to appreciate him and his good feeling towards their
country more.&nbsp; Major Pond, the well-known American, for
twenty years endeavoured to get the G.O.M.&mdash;as he has long
been known on both sides of the Atlantic&mdash;to cross the
Atlantic on a lecturing tour.&nbsp; In 1880 Mr. Gladstone wrote
to him: &lsquo;I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter,
with all the kindness it expresses and the dazzling prospects
which it offers.&nbsp; Unhappily, my reply lies not in vague
expressions of hope, but in the burden of seventy years and of
engagements and duties beyond my strength, by desertion of which,
even for the time needed, I should really be disentitling myself
to the goodwill of the American people, which I prize so
highly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this refusal, Major Pond
returned to the attack, and offered the Grand Old Man seven
thousand pounds for twenty lectures, which Mr. Gladstone
declined.&nbsp; As <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>a gentleman, he was bound to do so.&nbsp; It would have
been a sorry sight to have seen the G.O.M. carted all over
America as a show on a lecturing tour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Americans,&rsquo; says <i>Table Talk</i>, &lsquo;the
venerable ex-leader of the Liberal Party in the British
Parliament is not only a great Englishman, but the greatest of
all Englishmen, and his demise, which, it is to be hoped, will
yet be long postponed, will be regarded as a calamity to all the
English-speaking races.&nbsp; It has always been a matter of keen
regret throughout the American continent that Mr. Gladstone has
never been able to pay a visit to those whom the Grand Old Man
described in his memorable article in the <i>North American
Review</i> as &ldquo;kin beyond sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; In July, 1894,
a well-organized attempt was made to induce Mr. Gladstone to
cross the ocean.&nbsp; A letter of invitation was sent to him,
signed by the then Vice-President of the United States, Mr. Adlai
Stevenson, by Mr. Chauncey Depew, by Dr. Pepper, Provost of the
University of Pennsylvania, by seventy Senators and one hundred
Congressmen, by the Governors of a large number of the States, as
well as nearly all the members of Mr. Cleveland&rsquo;s Cabinet
and of the Supreme Bench at Washington.&nbsp; It was intimated to
the aged statesman that the most extraordinary arrangements would
be made for his comfort, including the most luxurious (of course,
free) transportation for himself, Mrs. Gladstone, and such
companions and attendants as he desired; a special service of
private cars on all the railways, and the unlimited use of an
Atlantic cable during the time of his absence from England.&nbsp;
Mr. Gladstone was also promised immunity from
&ldquo;interviewers, party politicians, advertisers, and
hand-shakers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>reply covered
three pages of large size writing-paper, and was written by
himself entirely.&nbsp; At that time, it will be remembered, Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s eyes were giving him great trouble, and he
pathetically wrote: &ldquo;Undoubtedly your letter supplied the
strongest motives for an attempt to brave the impossible.&nbsp;
But I regret to say it reaches me at a time when, were I much
younger, it could not be open to me to consider this
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same time, while unable to accept
such a flattering invitation, Mr. Gladstone, in concluding his
letter, begged that the American nation would remain assured of
&ldquo;my unalterable interest in your country.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was scarcely necessary to write that.&nbsp; In his
celebrated article on &lsquo;Kith and Kin&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone
had shown how far our American cousins had shot ahead of the old
folks at home.</p>
<p>In 1866 Sir Richard Temple wrote of the opening debate:
&lsquo;Next it was Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s turn to speak.&nbsp; I
had understood privately that he was going to make some
announcement that would imply the resignation of the Liberal
leadership.&nbsp; He was known to be disappointed at his failure
to obtain a majority at the General Election. . . .&nbsp; In
fact, however, he said nothing to imply resignation, but, on the
contrary, was evidently prepared to oppose the Government and
challenge them to propose a measure in favour of Ireland, if they
had one.&nbsp; It was in this speech that, alluding to his
reserve on the question of Home Rule until the fit moment for
action should arrive, he described himself as an old
Parliamentary hand.&nbsp; He had long been a coiner of phrases
that have become household words in Parliament, and yet this
description became famous among us at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Lord
Houghton writes in 1866: &lsquo;I sat by Gladstone at the
Delameres&rsquo;.&nbsp; He was very much excited, not only about
politics, but cattle plague, china, and everything else.&nbsp; It
is indeed a contrast to Palmerston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo;
and <i>laissez faire</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again in 1868 Lord
Houghton writes: &lsquo;Gladstone is the great triumph, but, as
he owns that he has to drive a four-in-hand consisting of English
Liberals, English Dissenters, Scotch Presbyterians, and Irish
Catholics, he requires all his courage to look his difficulties
in the face, and trust to surmount them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1849 Lord Malmesbury writes: &lsquo;Dined with the
Cannings, and met Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Phillimore.&nbsp; We were
anxious to see the former, as he is a man much spoken of as one
who will come to the front.&nbsp; We were disappointed at his
appearance, which is that of a Roman Catholic priest; but he is
very agreeable.&rsquo;&nbsp; On another occasion Malmesbury
speaks of Gladstone as &lsquo;a dark horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1866
Lady Palmerston tells Lord Malmesbury that his lordship had very
serious apprehensions as to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s future career,
and considered him a very dangerous and reckless
politician.&nbsp; About the same time Lord Palmerston said to the
Earl of Shaftesbury: &lsquo;Gladstone will soon have it all his
own way, and when he gets my place we shall have strange
doings.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little later on Lord Malmesbury refers to
the zest with which Mr. Gladstone had taken to singing nigger
melodies.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone in 1865, questioned on the subject of the Irish
Church, wrote: &lsquo;It would be very difficult for me to
subscribe to any interpretation of my speech on the Irish Church
like that of your correspondent, which contains so many
conditions and bases of a plan for <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>dealing with a question apparently
remote and at the same time full of difficulties on every
side.&nbsp; My reasons are, I think, plain.&nbsp; First, because
the question is remote, and out of all bearing on the practical
politics of the day, I think it would be far worse for me than
superfluous to determine upon any scheme or bases of a scheme
with respect to it.&nbsp; Secondly, because it is difficult, even
if I anticipated any likelihood of being called on to deal with
it, I should think it right to take no decision beforehand as to
the mode of dealing with the difficulties.&nbsp; But my first
reason is that which chiefly sways.&nbsp; As far as I know, my
speech signifies pretty clearly the broad distinction between the
abstract and the practical views of the subject.&nbsp; And I
think I have stated strongly my sense of the responsibility
attaching to the opening of such a question except in a state of
things which gives promise of satisfactorily settling it. . .
.&nbsp; In any measure dealing with the Church of Ireland, I
think (though I scarcely expect ever to be called on to share in
such a measure), the Act of Union must be recognised, and must
have important consequences, especially with reference to the
position of the hierarchy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A little amusement will be created by the following:</p>
<p>Mr. Jerningham, author of &lsquo;Reminiscences of an
Attach&eacute;,&rsquo; met Mr. Gladstone at Strawberry Hill just
after the Liberal defeat on the Reform Bill.&nbsp; Sitting near
him at breakfast, Mr. Jerningham asked Mr. Gladstone for his
autograph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you must
ask me a question on paper, and I will answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was twenty-three years of age&mdash;very proud of
being in such interesting company at such a time, and therefore
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>most
anxious to justify my presence by some clever question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote down quickly the following, and, rather pleased
with it, gave it to Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; It ran thus: &ldquo;What
is Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s opinion of the difference which exists
in 1866 between a Liberal and a moderate Conservative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone crumpled up the paper, and, apparently
much annoyed, said he did not think he could answer such a
question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was so concerned by his look of vexation that I went
up to one of the ladies and repeated my question to her, so as to
gather from her in which way I had offended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She nearly screamed&mdash;at least, so far as that
person could ever utter a sound&mdash;and asked how I could ever
have been so bold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The truth dawned upon me.&nbsp; The moderate
Conservatives of 1866 had dissolved a powerful Liberal Ministry,
and I had inquired what he thought of them&mdash;of the very
statesman who had put their moderate principles to the
test.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this <i>faux pas</i> one is not surprised that Mr.
Jerningham rejoiced that a dinner in town obliged him to leave
his hosts on that very afternoon.&nbsp; But, after all, the storm
soon blew over, and the incident had a pleasant ending.&nbsp; As
Mr. Jerningham was on his way to Richmond, whom should he find
upon the boat at Twickenham but Mr. Gladstone himself!&nbsp; So
ends the tale:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I very modestly bade good-bye to him without any
allusion to my indiscretion of the morning; but with infinite
kindness and charm of manner, he said, &ldquo;I have not
forgotten you,&rdquo; and pulled out of his pocket my original
question and his characteristic answer to it:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Strawberry Hill, June 24, 1866.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The word Moderate, as far as my observation
goes, does no great credit&mdash;according to the manner in which
it is now used&mdash;either to the word Liberal or to the word
Conservative.&nbsp; Every Liberal claims to be Conservative;
every Conservative to be Liberal.&nbsp; I know of no solution of
the question between them except the test of their works.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;&ldquo;Yours very truly,<br
/>
&lsquo;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">W. E.
Gladstone</span>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Count Beust says: &lsquo;When I was ambassador in London, Mr.
Gladstone, who was then in office, was caricatured with his
colleagues in a piece called &ldquo;The Happy Land,&rdquo; at the
Court Theatre.&nbsp; This annoyed the Premier, and the piece was
taken off.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">POLITICS AND THE IRISH CHURCH.</span></h2>
<p>In the General Election for 1865 Mr. Gladstone lost his seat
for the University of Oxford.&nbsp; For years it was evident that
his advancing views were gradually drifting him from the Oxford
constituents, and when an Act was passed to enable country
clergymen and non-resident M.A.&rsquo;s&mdash;by means of voting
papers&mdash;to swamp the real Oxford constituency, Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s seat was gone, and his opponent, Mr. Hardy,
triumphed.&nbsp; The battle was bravely fought, and the blow was
severely felt by Mr. Gladstone and his friends.&nbsp; In his
farewell address Mr. Gladstone said: &lsquo;After an arduous
connection of seven years, now I bid you farewell.&nbsp; My
earnest purpose to serve you&mdash;my many faults and
shortcomings&mdash;the incidents of the political relationship
between myself and the University established in 1847, so often
questioned in vain, and now at length finally dissolved&mdash;I
leave to the judgment of the future.&nbsp; It is an imperative
duty, and one alone which induces me to trouble you with these
few parting words&mdash;the duty of expressing my profound and
lasting gratitude for indulgence as generous, and for support as
warm and enthusiastic in itself, and as honourable from the
character and distinctions of those who have <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>given it, as
has, in my belief, ever been given by any constituency to any
representative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The salient figure,&rsquo; writes Sir Richard Temple,
&lsquo;was the impressive personality of Mr. Gladstone himself,
who was quite the figure-head in this Parliament.&nbsp; Naturally
he was no longer the handsome man with the beautiful voice who
had been wont to charm a listening senate.&nbsp; But still his
attitude was noble, picturesque, and when under excitement he was
grandly leonine.&nbsp; Advanced age had left its trace on him
outwardly, and had impaired his matchless powers of
elocution.&nbsp; The once resonant voice often would become
husky, and at times almost inaudible, so that his voice rose and
fell with a cadence like the wind.&nbsp; But his persuasiveness
for many minds remained in its highest degree.&nbsp; His
impassioned gesture seemed to be quieter; it could not
conceivably have been finer than it was in those days.&nbsp; When
excited in speech, he would sweep his arm round like the play of
a scimitar, and yet with a movement both graceful and
appropriate.&nbsp; His hands, too, were most impressive, and by
their motion or action helped him to enforce his arguments.&nbsp;
Above all, there was the play of features on the careworn
countenance.&nbsp; Evidently he was in the highest sense of the
term one of Nature&rsquo;s orators.&rsquo;&nbsp; The quality of
his speeches was not quite what it had once been in all
respects.&nbsp; The passion, the glow, the sympathy, the
magnetism remained as of yore.</p>
<p>At the Oxford election Dr. Pusey wrote to a friend: &lsquo;You
are naturally rejoicing over the defeat of Mr. Gladstone, which I
mourn.&nbsp; Some of those who concurred in that election or
stood aloof will, I fear, mourn hereafter because they were the
cause of that rejection.&nbsp; <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>The grounds alleged against Mr.
Gladstone bore at the utmost upon the Establishment.&nbsp; The
Establishment might perish and the Church might come forth the
purer.&nbsp; If the Church were corrupted the Establishment would
become a curse in proportion to its influence.&nbsp; As that
conflict will thicken, Oxford will, I think, learn to regret her
rude severance from one so loyal to the Church, to the faith, and
to God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking in the Free Trade Hall in Manchester during the South
Lancashire election, Mr. Gladstone said: &lsquo;After an anxious
struggle of eighteen years, during which the unbounded devotion
and indulgence of my friends have maintained me in the arduous
position of representative of the University of Oxford, I have
been driven from that position; but do not let me come among you
under false colours or with a false pretence.&nbsp; I have loved
the University of Oxford with a deep and passionate love, and as
long as I live that attachment will continue.&nbsp; If my
affection is of the smallest advantage to that great, that noble,
that ancient institution, that advantage, such as it is&mdash;and
it is most insignificant&mdash;that attachment Oxford will
possess as long as I breathe.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t mistake the
issue which has been raised.&nbsp; The University has at length,
after eighteen years of self-denial, been drawn by what I might
call the overweening exercise of power into the vortex of mere
party politics.&nbsp; Well, you will readily understand why, as
long as I had a hope that the zeal and kindness of my friends
might keep me in my place, it was not possible for me to abandon
them.&nbsp; Could they have returned me by but a majority of one,
painful as it is to a man at my time of life, and feeling the
weight of public cares, to be incessantly struggling for his
seat, <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>nothing could have induced me to quit the University to
which I had so long devoted my best care and attachment.&nbsp;
But by no act of mine I am free to come among you.&nbsp; And
having thus been set free, I need hardly tell you that it is with
joy, with thankfulness and enthusiasm that I now, at the eleventh
hour, make my appeal to the heart and mind of South Lancashire,
and ask you to pronounce upon that appeal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone then described what had been done by himself and
party, commencing with the emancipation of the Roman Catholics,
dwelling on the reformation of the Poor Law, the reformation of
the tariffs, the abolition of the Corn Laws, the abolition of the
Navigation Laws, the conclusion of the French Treaty, the removal
of laws which have relieved Dissenters from stigma and almost
ignominy, adding: &lsquo;I can truly say that there is no period
of my life during which my conscience is so clear, and renders me
so good an answer, as those years in which I have co-operated in
the promotion of Liberal measures.&nbsp; Because they are Liberal
they are the true measures, and indicate the true policy by which
the country is made strong and its institutions
preserved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a speech delivered the same evening at the amphitheatre at
Liverpool, Mr. Gladstone continued: &lsquo;I am, if possible,
more firmly attached to the institutions of my country than when
a boy I wandered among the sand-hills of Seaforth.&nbsp; But
experience has brought its lessons.&nbsp; I have learned that
there is wisdom in a policy of trust, and folly in a policy of
mistrust.&nbsp; I have observed the effect which has been
produced by Liberal legislation; and if we are told that the
policy of the country is in the best and broadest sense
Conservative, honesty <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>compels me to admit that that result
has been brought about by Liberal legislation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>About this time the Duke of Newcastle died, leaving Mr.
Gladstone a trustee of his son&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
this capacity,&rsquo; writes Mr. G. W. E. Russell, &lsquo;the
Chancellor of the Exchequer applied himself with characteristic
thoroughness to the duties pertaining to the management of a
rural property, and acquired in the superintendence of the
woodlands of Chester that practical knowledge of woodcraft which
has since afforded him such constant interest and
occupation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The new Parliament was opened on February 6, 1866, the Queen
appearing at the ceremony for the first time since her
widowhood.&nbsp; In offering his services to Earl Russell, after
the death of Palmerston, Mr. Gladstone wrote: &lsquo;I am sore
with conflicts about the public expenditure, which I feel that
other men would have escaped, or conducted more gently and less
fretfully.&nbsp; I am quite willing to retire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As one of the Ministers who engaged in the Crimean War, Mr.
Gladstone had to leave office, Lord Derby being unable to form a
Ministry, as Mr. Gladstone and the Peelites would not join
him.&nbsp; Lord Palmerston became Premier, and Mr. Gladstone
returned to office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, but resigned
three weeks afterwards, on the ground that the Government
assented to Mr. Roebuck&rsquo;s motion for a committee to inquire
into the conduct of the war.&nbsp; Twenty years after Mr.
Gladstone contended: &lsquo;The design of the Crimean War was in
its groundwork the vindication of European law against an
unprovoked aggression.&nbsp; It sought, therefore, to maintain
intact the condition of the menaced party against the aggressor;
or, in other <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>words, to defend against Russia the integrity and
independence of the Ottoman Empire.&rsquo;&nbsp; This resignation
took place in February, 1855, and Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s position
in consequence became very isolated.&nbsp; According to his
subsequent statement, he was driven from office.&nbsp; His
sympathies, he owns, were with the Conservatives, his opinions
with the Liberals.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Oxford writes of Gladstone as in the highest
sense of the term &lsquo;Liberal&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;detested by
the aristocracy for his succession duty, the most truly
Conservative measure passed in my recollection.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet
Mr. Gladstone was still as eager as ever in Church matters.&nbsp;
Archdeacon Denison had been prosecuted for teaching the doctrine
of the Real Presence, and was condemned by Dr. Lushington, acting
as assessor to Archbishop Sumner.&nbsp; Gladstone wrote:
&lsquo;Whatever comes of it, two things are pretty clear: The
first, that not only with the executive authorities, but in the
sacred halls of justice, there are now two measures, and not one,
in use&mdash;the straight one, for those supposed to err in
believing too much; and the other for those who believe too
little.&nbsp; The second is, that this is another blow to the
dogmatic principle in the Established Church, the principle on
which, as a Church, it rests, and on which, as an establishment,
it seems less and less permitted to rest.&nbsp; No hasty judgment
is pardonable in these matters; but for the last ten or twelve
years the skies have been darkening for a storm.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Again he writes: &lsquo;The stewards of doctrine should, on the
general ground of controversy and disturbance, deliver from their
pulpits, or as they think fit, to the people the true and
substantive doctrine of the Holy Eucharist.&nbsp; This freely
done, and without any notice of the Archbishop or Dr. Lushington,
I <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>should
think far better for the time than any declaration.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone, as leader of the House, introduced a Reform
Bill Lord Russell laboured at in the Cabinet, which was not very
cordial in its favour, but he was supported by Mr. Gladstone,
deciding to deal only with the question of the franchise, and
leaving the question of redistribution to a later time.&nbsp; The
Bill, which was introduced by Mr. Gladstone on March 12, proposed
the reduction of the county franchise from &pound;50 to
&pound;14, and of the borough franchise from &pound;10 to
&pound;7.&nbsp; Some people seemed to think that Mr. Gladstone
did not speak with his accustomed force; but that may be
accounted for by the remembrance that he had to speak to a House
not very enthusiastic in favour of Parliamentary reform.&nbsp;
But the first reading was carried after two nights&rsquo; debate,
and the second reading was fixed for April 12.&nbsp; It was,
however, evident that, while the Conservative party were
organized, the Liberals on their side were divided and
indifferent.&nbsp; They argued with some force that the
Government had brought forward only half of its scheme, and that
it was impolitic and unstatesmanlike to accept one portion of the
scheme without being acquainted with the whole.&nbsp; Lord
Grosvenor, though sitting on the Liberal benches, declared that
he would meet the second reading by a resolution to that effect;
while Mr. Kinglake, the author of &lsquo;Eothen,&rsquo; aiming at
the same end, but anxious to secure the maintenance of the
Government, announced that he should ask the House of Commons to
declare that it was not expedient to go into Committee on the
Bill until the House had before it the expected Bill for the
redistribution of seats.&nbsp; The House, however, passed the
second reading, but by a <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>majority so small that the
continuance of the Ministry in power was difficult.&nbsp; The
Ministry, however, decided to persevere, and in April introduced
three additional measures&mdash;a Redistribution Bill for England
and Wales, and Reform Bills for Scotland and Ireland.&nbsp; But
the condition of affairs did not improve&mdash;on the contrary,
grew worse; and on June 1 Lord Dunkellin, the eldest son of Lord
Clanricarde, carried a motion against the Government,
substituting rating for rental as the basis of the borough
franchise.&nbsp; The Ministry resigned, and Lord John Russell as
a Parliamentary leader disappears from history.</p>
<p>There were people who hinted that Lord John was jealous of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; Such does not seem to have been
the case.&nbsp; In 1853 his lordship wrote to Lady John:
&lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;s speech was magnificent.&nbsp; It
rejoices me to be a party to so large a plan, and to do with a
man who seeks to benefit the country rather than to carry a
majority by a concession to fear.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, when the
question of privilege arose on the action of the Lords with
regard to the paper duty, Lord John told the Duke of Bedford that
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s speech was &lsquo;magnificently
mad.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1867 Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord John:
&lsquo;My political relations with you have been late in
life.&nbsp; I moved to you, not you to me; and ever since we have
been in contact&mdash;that is to say, during the last fifteen
years&mdash;my co-operation with you has been associated all
along with feelings of warm attachment and regard.&nbsp; Every
motion that moves me further from you is painful to me. . .
.&nbsp; If you do not stand without a rival, I, for one, do not
know where to look for your superior in the annals of British
legislation.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little later on, when Mr. Gladstone
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>brought
forward the motion which sounded the knell of the Tory Government
and of the Established Church in Ireland, Lord John presided at
an enthusiastic meeting, held in St. James&rsquo;s Hall, London,
to support Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s policy; and when, in December,
1868, Mr. Gladstone formed his first Administration, one of the
first persons he wrote to to join him was Lord John.&nbsp; Upon
the refusal of the latter, on the plea of age, Mr. Gladstone
wrote: &lsquo;The snapping of ties is never pleasant, but your
resolution is probably a wise one.&nbsp; Perhaps it is selfish of
me to think of and mention them, rather than dwell upon those
ties which inseparably associate your name with so many great and
noble passages in the history of our country.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
again, when Mr. Gladstone had introduced his Irish Land Act, he
wrote to Lord John: &lsquo;We have had a most anxious time with
regard to the Irish Land Bill.&nbsp; Often do I think of a saying
of yours more than thirty years back, which struck me
ineffaceably at the time.&nbsp; You said the true key to an Irish
debate was this: that it was not properly borne in mind that as
England is inhabited by Englishmen, and Scotland by Scotchmen, so
Ireland is inhabited by Irishmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let us return to the Reform Bill.&nbsp; It was evident that
London was getting excited on the subject.&nbsp; When the
Liberals resigned in June, some ten thousand people assembled in
Trafalgar Square and passed strong resolutions in favour of
Reform.&nbsp; They then marched to Carlton House, singing
litanies and hymns in honour of Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; As he was
away, Mrs. Gladstone and her family came out on the balcony to
acknowledge the popular tribute.&nbsp; At meetings all over
England Mr. Gladstone was hailed as the hero of the <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>people.&nbsp; He had become &lsquo;the People&rsquo;s
William.&rsquo;&nbsp; On July 13 Lord Houghton wrote to a friend
on the Continent: &lsquo;The change of Ministry has passed over
very quietly.&nbsp; It was a real collapse, and inevitable by
human skill.&nbsp; Gladstone showed a fervour of conviction which
has won him the attachment of three hundred men and the horror of
the rest of the House of Commons.&nbsp; He will be all the better
for a year or two of opposition.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in the
course of this debate that Mr. Gladstone, replying to Lord R.
Montagu&rsquo;s expression that the working classes, if armed
with the franchise, would be an invading and destroying army,
evoked a ringing cheer when, in a climax of enthusiasm, he asked:
&lsquo;Are they not our own flesh and blood?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the autumn Mr. Gladstone, with his family, spent a short
while in Rome, where he had an interview with the Pope, which
gave rise to rumours he had formally to deny, that during that
visit he had made arrangements with the Pope to destroy the Irish
Church Establishment, and that he was a Roman Catholic in
heart.</p>
<p>In 1867 Mr. Disraeli, as leader of the House of Commons,
introduced his celebrated Reform Bill, or, rather, Reform
Resolutions.&nbsp; He proposed to reduce the occupation franchise
for boroughs to a &pound;6 rating, in counties to
&pound;20.&nbsp; The franchise was also to be extended to persons
having &pound;50 in the funds or &pound;50 in a savings bank for
a year.&nbsp; Payment of &pound;20 of direct taxes would also be
a title to the franchise, as would a University degree.&nbsp;
Votes would further be given to clergymen, ministers of religion
generally, members of the learned professions, and certificated
schoolmasters.&nbsp; It was proposed to disfranchise Yarmouth,
Lancaster, <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>Reigate, and Totnes, and to take one member each from
twenty-three boroughs with less than seven thousand
inhabitants.&nbsp; The House would have thirty seats to dispose
of, and it was proposed to allot fourteen of them to new boroughs
in the Northern and Midland districts, fifteen to counties, and
one to the London University; the second division of the Tower
Hamlets two members, and several new county divisions would have
two additional members each.&nbsp; The scheme would add 212,000
voters to the boroughs, and 206,500 to the counties.&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone pointed out the inconvenience of proceeding by
resolution, and the Government undertook to introduce a Bill.</p>
<p>In March, 1867, the Bill was introduced, much to the
dissatisfaction of Lord Cranborne, now Lord Salisbury, the Earl
of Carnarvon, and General Peel, who resigned the offices they
held.&nbsp; But the Bill was read a second time without a
dissentient; the fight in the Committee was short and
sharp.&nbsp; In May Lord Houghton writes: &lsquo;I met Gladstone
at breakfast.&nbsp; He seemed quite awed with the diabolical
wickedness of Dizzy, who, he says, is gradually driving all ideas
of political honour out of the House, and accustoming it to the
most revolting cynicism.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this time it is
understood that there was a temporary want of harmony between Mr.
Gladstone and some of his supporters.&nbsp; When the Bill was
read a third time Lord Cranborne denied emphatically that it was
a Conservative triumph.&nbsp; The Bill, he said, had been
modified at the dictation of Mr. Gladstone, who demanded, first,
the lodger franchise; secondly, the abolition of the distinction
between compounders and non-compounders; thirdly, a provision to
prevent traffic in votes; fourthly, the omission of the taxing <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>franchise;
fifthly, the omission of the dual vote; sixthly, the enlargement
of the distribution of seats; seventhly, the reduction of the
county franchise, the omission of voting-papers, and the omission
of the educational and savings banks franchise.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If,&rsquo; continued his lordship, &lsquo;the adoption of
the principles of Mr. Bright could be described as a triumph,
then the Conservative party in the whole history of its previous
annals had won no such signal triumph before.&nbsp; I
desire,&rsquo; continued Lord Cranbourne, &lsquo;to protest in
the most earnest language I am capable of against the political
morality on which the measures of this year have been
passed.&nbsp; If you borrow your politics from the ethics of the
political adventurer, you may depend upon it the whole of your
political institutions will crumble beneath your
feet.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the House of Lords Earl Derby unblushingly
described it as a leap in the dark.&nbsp; Shooting Niagara it was
described by Carlyle.&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli, however, rejoiced with
exceeding joy over the event.&nbsp; By his own energy and faith
in himself he had attained to the highest distinction&mdash;yet
still many regarded him with distrust.&nbsp; In August Bishop
Wilberforce writes: &lsquo;No one can even guess at the political
future.&nbsp; Whether a fresh election will strengthen the
Conservatives or not seems altogether doubtful.&nbsp; The most
wonderful thing is the rise of Disraeli.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this time Mr. Maurice wrote to his son: &lsquo;I am glad
you have seen Gladstone, and have been able to judge a little of
what his face indicates.&nbsp; It is a very expressive
one&mdash;hard-worked, as you say; not, perhaps, especially
happy; more indicative of struggle than of victory, but not
without promise of that.&nbsp; I admire him for his patient
attention to details, and for the pains <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>which he
takes to prevent himself from being absorbed in them.&nbsp; He
has preserved the type which I remember he bore at the University
thirty-six years ago, though it has undergone curious
developments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When in February, 1868, Parliament met, it was announced that
Lord Derby, owing to failing health, had resigned&mdash;that Mr.
Disraeli was to be Premier.&nbsp; And then came Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp; The Liberal party, once more
united, had things all their own way.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone brought
in a Bill to abolish compulsory Church rates, and that was
carried.&nbsp; He announced that he held the condition of the
Irish Church to be unsatisfactory.&nbsp; In March he moved:
&lsquo;1. That in the opinion of this House it is necessary that
the Established Church of Ireland should cease to exist as an
Establishment, due regard being had for all personal interests
and to all individual rights of property.&nbsp; 2. That, subject
to the foregoing considerations, it is expedient to prevent the
creation of new personal interests by the exercise of any public
patronage, and to confine the operations of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners to objects of immediate necessity or involving
individual rights, pending the final decision of
Parliament.&nbsp; 3. That an humble address be presented to Her
Majesty, humbly to pray that, with a view to the purposes
aforesaid, Her Majesty will be graciously pleased to place at the
disposal of Parliament interest in the temporalities, in
archbishoprics, bishoprics, and other ecclesiastical dignities
and benefices in Ireland and in the custody thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; writes Bishop Wilberforce, &lsquo;Mr.
Gladstone has moved the attack on the Irish Church.&nbsp; It is
altogether a bad business, and I am afraid Gladstone has been
drawn into it from the unconscious influence <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>of his
restlessness at being out of office.&nbsp; I have no doubt that
his hatred to the low tone of the Irish Church has had a great
deal to do with it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For many years the subject had been before the public.&nbsp; A
Royal Commission had been appointed to deal with the question,
and it had given rise to more than one debate in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s own adoption of the policy
of Disestablishment had been made evident in a speech delivered
July, 1867, although he abstained from voting.&nbsp; His relation
to the question had, however, as he indicated, been practically
declared for more than twenty years.&nbsp; A year later, on a
motion by Mr. Maguire, &lsquo;that this House resolves itself
into a Committee with the view of taking into consideration the
condition and circumstances of Ireland,&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone
spoke more decidedly, declaring that, in order to the settlement
of the condition of the Irish, the Church as a State Church must
cease to exist, and in consequence of this declaration Mr.
Maguire withdrew his motion.&nbsp; On the first division on Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s resolutions he obtained a majority of sixty
against Government.&nbsp; Subsequent divisions having confirmed
and increased this majority, Mr. Disraeli announced on May 4 that
he had advised Her Majesty to dissolve Parliament in the coming
autumn, in order that the opinion of the country might be taken
on the great issue put before it.&nbsp; Great was the excitement
everywhere, and many were the public meetings held on the subject
in all parts of England.&nbsp; At a meeting of Church supporters
held in St. James&rsquo;s Hall in May, Archbishop Longley in the
chair, there were twenty-five bishops on the platform, besides an
array of peers and M.P.&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Archbishop Tait, who moved
the first resolution, referring to a speech of his own on the <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Church Rate
Bill, writes to his son: &lsquo;Gladstone fell foul of it
somewhat roughly on moving his Irish Church resolutions, but last
Sunday your mother and I went to the little church in Windmill
Street which Mr. Kempe has built for the poor of St.
James&rsquo;s, and there found Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone taking
refuge from the glare of London for a quiet Sunday morning; and
as we all walked home together, I had some most agreeable
conversation with him.&nbsp; I wish he was not so strangely
impetuous, for he is certainly a good Christian. . . .&nbsp; I
almost hope that something may be done to bring him to reason
about reforming, not destroying, the Irish Church.&nbsp; This, no
doubt, is what the Old Whigs really desire, if only they could
get Disraeli out.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli soon
gratified&mdash;at any rate, to a certain extent&mdash;the Old
Whigs.&nbsp; In November the constituencies replied to the appeal
made to them by Mr. Disraeli by an almost unprecedented majority
for his opponent.&nbsp; The national verdict could no longer be
opposed.&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli himself recognised the fact by
resigning office without waiting for the meeting of
Parliament.&nbsp; When Parliament met in February, Mr. Gladstone
was Premier.&nbsp; Defeated in Lancashire, he had been elected
for Greenwich.</p>
<p>There were, of course, party cavillings when the member for
Greenwich was gazetted in August, 1873, as Chancellor of the
Exchequer without vacating his seat for the Metropolitan borough;
but the polemics in the press gradually ceased upon the subject,
without materially weakening his influence upon his pledged
supporters, and the public at large hardly found time to listen
to the controversy.&nbsp; Trade was good, and remunerative
enterprise continued to advance by leaps <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and
bounds&mdash;to borrow one of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s famous
phrases.&nbsp; On one occasion, when a Tory member argued against
a certain measure that it was not the right time to introduce it,
Mr. Bernal Osborne wittily exclaimed: &lsquo;Not the right time,
sir?&nbsp; We take our time from Greenwich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had Parliament met than the Queen, in order to
smooth the difficulties of the question, wrote to Bishop Tait,
who had then become Archbishop of Canterbury: &lsquo;The Queen
has seen Mr. Gladstone, who shows the most conciliatory
disposition.&nbsp; He really seems to be moderate in his views,
and anxious, so far as he properly and consistently can do so, to
meet the wishes of those who would maintain the Irish
Church.&nbsp; He at once assured the Queen of his
readiness&mdash;and, indeed, his anxiety&mdash;to meet the
Archbishop and to communicate freely with him on the subject of
this most important question; and the Queen must express her hope
that the Archbishop will meet him in the same
spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Government could do nothing that would
tend to raise a suspicion of their sincerity in proposing to
disendow the Irish Church, and to withdraw all State endowments
from all religious communities in Ireland, but with these
conditions accepted, all other matters connected with the
question might, the Queen thought, thus become the subject of
discussion and negotiation.&nbsp; The interview, when it took
place, seems to have much relieved the Archbishop&rsquo;s mind,
especially as Mr. Gladstone at that date had not made public any
authoritative statement of the shape which his Disestablishment
policy was to assume.&nbsp; The Archbishop used to say in
after-years that his position after the interview for about ten
days was the most difficult he had ever known.&nbsp; In addition
to the <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>necessarily urgent correspondence of such a time, he
had to grant interviews to men of every sort and condition who
came to consult, inform or interrogate him upon the absorbing
topic which was on every lip; and he had not merely to give
attention to larger comments and conjectures, and to say
something suitable in reply, but to keep entirely secret all the
while the scheme which Mr. Gladstone had unfolded to him, and
even the fact that such a communication had taken place.</p>
<p>At length came Monday, March 1, and Mr. Gladstone unfolded his
scheme.&nbsp; For some three hours and a half Mr. Gladstone
occupied the attention&mdash;the absorbed attention&mdash;of an
eager House.&nbsp; It was one of his grandest oratorical
triumphs.&nbsp; Complicated details, which in other hands would
have been dry and lifeless, kept the listener spellbound.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was strange,&rsquo; writes the Archbishop, &lsquo;to
hear Gladstone on Monday last unfold his scheme in the House of
Commons, knowing beforehand what it was all to be, and having,
indeed, had a rehearsal of it in my library.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Bill was in accordance with the
resolutions he had moved when in opposition.&nbsp; The actual
moment of Disestablishment he proposed to postpone until January
1, 1871; but from the passing of the Act the creation of private
interests was to cease, and the property of the Church was to
pass at once into the hands of Commissioners appointed for the
purpose.&nbsp; All the ecclesiastical laws of the Disestablished
Church were to exist as a binding contract to regulate the
internal affairs of the Disestablished Church until such time as
they should be altered by the voluntary agency of whatever new
governing body would be appointed.&nbsp; The churches and
burial-grounds were to become on <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>application the property of the
Disestablished Church, and the glebe-houses as well, on payment
of the somewhat heavy existing building charges.&nbsp; The whole
value of the Church property was estimated at sixteen millions;
of this sum, &pound;8,500,000 would be swallowed up in the
necessary compensation of various kinds, and the remaining seven
and a half millions would be applied to the advantage of the
Irish people, but not to Church purposes.&nbsp; Special provision
was made for incumbents and unbeneficed curates.&nbsp; As to the
post-Reformation grants, Mr. Gladstone fixed a dividing line at
the year 1680, agreeing that all grants made from private sources
subsequent to that year should be handed over intact to the
Disestablished Church.&nbsp; As to the remaining seven millions
and a half, it was to be devoted to the relief &lsquo;of
unavoidable calamities and suffering not provided for by the Poor
Law,&rsquo; to the support of lunatic and idiot asylums,
institutions for the relief of the deaf and dumb and blind, and
other kindred objects.&nbsp; These details, one after another,
were set forth with great clearness, and the speech was closed
with a magnificent peroration, which drew a warm tribute of
admiration even from the bitterest opponents of the Bill.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons the Bill was carried triumphantly, in
spite of good debating on the part of its enemies.&nbsp; On the
second reading, the division was 368 for, 250 against.&nbsp; But
it was in the Lords that the battle was chiefly fought, when the
second reading was carried, after a debate which lasted till
three in the morning, by 179 against 146.&nbsp; Upon a division
being called, the two English Archbishops, amid a scene of
intense excitement, retired to the steps of the throne, which are
technically not within the <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>House; Bishop Wilberforce and
several Conservative peers withdrew.&nbsp; Among the
Conservatives who voted with the Government were Lord Salisbury,
Lord Bath, Lord Devon, Lord Carnarvon, and Lord Nelson.&nbsp; The
only Bishop who voted with the Government was Bishop Thirlwall,
of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Thirteen English and three Irish
Bishops voted on the other side.&nbsp; But in Committee the Lords
tacked on sixty-two amendments.&nbsp; <i>Punch</i> had a clever
cartoon on the occasion.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Canterbury was
represented as a gipsy nurse giving back a changeling instead of
the child that had been presented to him, saying, &lsquo;Which
we&rsquo;ve took the greatest care of &rsquo;m,
ma&rsquo;m,&rsquo; while Mrs. the Prime Minister replies,
&lsquo;This is not <i>my</i> child&mdash;not in the least like
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Ministerialists described the Bill to be so
mutilated as to be practically useless, and the vociferous
Radical cheers which greeted Mr. Gladstone as he rose on July 15
to move that the Lords&rsquo; amendments be considered were
significant of the temper of the House.&nbsp; Nothing could be
more uncompromising than his speech.&nbsp; He made no attempt to
soften down the differences; he even accentuated their gravity,
as he recounted the amendments one by one, and called upon the
House to reject the preposterous proposals of men who had shown
themselves to be as ignorant of the feelings of the country as if
they had been &lsquo;living in a balloon.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
insisted on the rejection of each and every clause which
involved, however indirectly, the proposal of concurrent
endowment; he declined to sanction the postponement of the date
of Disestablishment; and he declined to leave the disposal of the
anticipated surplus to the wisdom of a future Parliament.&nbsp;
He consented, however, to allow a reconsideration <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>of the
commutation terms, and he went further than some of his
supporters in agreeing to give the lump half-million in lieu of
the private endowments which had been so much discussed.&nbsp;
His unyielding attitude made the Lords furious.&nbsp; When the
Peers met, after a debate of quite unusual warmth, they resolved
by a majority of 74 to agree to the first and most important of
their amendments&mdash;the authorization of the principle of
concurrent endowments.&nbsp; Lord Granville immediately adjourned
the House to take counsel with his colleagues.&nbsp; It seemed as
if a collision between the two Houses was inevitable.&nbsp;
However, Mr. Gladstone and Lord Cairns met, a compromise was
effected, the danger of a collision between the two Houses was
avoided, and the Bill for Disestablishing and Disendowing the
Irish Church&mdash;which Mr. Gladstone had enthusiastically and
somewhat sanguinely believed to be a message of peace to
Ireland&mdash;became law.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Canterbury, who
had been one of the chief instruments in the negotiations, writes
in his diary: &lsquo;We have made the best terms we could, and,
thanks to the Queen, a collision between the Houses has been
averted; but a great occasion has been poorly used, and the Irish
Church has been greatly injured without any benefits to the Roman
Catholics.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Ireland the scheme was met with mingled emotions.&nbsp; The
Church party were in despair, and their attachment to England was
undoubtedly weakened.&nbsp; One of the ablest of Irish
patriots&mdash;Mr. John O&rsquo;Neill Daunt&mdash;wrote:
&lsquo;The scheme, as set forth, is to some extent undoubtedly a
disendowment scheme, but objectionable in not going so far in
that direction as Mr. Gladstone might have done with propriety
and with <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>full consideration for the vested interests of existing
incumbents.&nbsp; His capitation scheme is, in fact, a plan for
re-endowment, by which several millions of money, obtained by the
sale of Church property, will be permanently abstracted from the
Irish public and appropriated to the ecclesiastical uses of the
present State Churchmen and their successors.&nbsp; This is
anything but equality, and cannot be accepted as a final
settlement by the Irish nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he writes:
&lsquo;The Lords have passed Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Bill, with
some mutilations, to which the Commons finally assented in a
conference.&nbsp; The Bill is a wretched abortion&mdash;in fact,
it is such a sham as might have been expected from an English
Parliament.&nbsp; It pretends to disendow the State Church, which
it re-endows with about five-eighths of the Church property in a
capitalized shape. . . .&nbsp; If Gladstone were an honest friend
of Ireland, he could have averted all this danger by withholding
the power to capitalize.&nbsp; To be sure, it is a queer
disendowment that sends off the parsons with five-eighths of the
money in their pockets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he writes: &lsquo;On
the whole, I dare say we have a sort of qualified
triumph&mdash;nothing to boast of, considering that the result of
nearly thirteen years&rsquo; agitation is a measure that enables
the parsons to walk off with ten or eleven millions of our money
in their pockets, <i>that still exacts from us the rascally
rent-charge</i>, and that swindles Ireland of the amount of Irish
taxes heretofore kept in the country by Maynooth and the
<i>Regium Donum</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor were the English Dissenters, by whose aid Mr. Gladstone
had carried the Bill, very much elated about it.&nbsp; Their
organ, the <i>British Quarterly Review</i>, at some length showed
how Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s pretended disendowment <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>had given
back the State Church property to the disestablished clergy in a
capitalized shape.&nbsp; It was enough for the mob to feel that
Mr. Gladstone had put an end to the Irish State Church&mdash;that
upas-tree which had long blighted the country.&nbsp; Be that as
it may, nothing was more beautiful than Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
peroration when he moved his resolutions.&nbsp; Said he:
&lsquo;There are many who think that to lay hands on the National
Church Establishment is a profane and unhallowed act.&nbsp; I
sympathize with it.&nbsp; I sympathize with it, while I think it
is my duty to overcome and suppress it.&nbsp; There is something
in the idea of a National Establishment of religion&mdash;of a
solemn appropriation of a part of the commonwealth for conferring
upon all who are ready to receive it what we know to be an
inestimable benefit; of saving that part or portion of the
inheritance from private selfishness, in order to extract from
it, if we can, pure and unmixed advantages of the highest order
for the population at large.&nbsp; There is something attractive
in this&mdash;so attractive that it is an image that must always
command the homage of the many.&nbsp; It is somewhat like the
kingly ghost in &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; of which one of the
characters of Shakespeare says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We do it wrong, being so
majestical,<br />
To offer it the show of violence;<br />
But it is as the air invulnerable,<br />
And our vain blows malicious mockery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, sir, this is to view a religious Establishment upon one
side only&mdash;upon what I may call the ethereal side; it has
likewise a side of earth.&nbsp; And here I cannot do better than
quote some lines written by the present Archbishop of Dublin at a
time when his genius was devoted to the Muses.&nbsp; He said,
speaking of mankind:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>&lsquo;&ldquo;We who did our lineage high<br />
Draw from beyond the starry sky,<br />
Are yet upon the other side,<br />
To earth and to its dust allied.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the Church Establishment, regarded in its theory and
its aim, is beautiful and attractive.&nbsp; Yet what is it but an
appropriation of public property&mdash;an appropriation of the
fruits of labour and skill to certain purposes; and unless those
purposes are fulfilled, that appropriation cannot be
justified.&nbsp; Therefore, sir, I think we must set aside fears,
which thrust themselves upon the imagination, and act upon the
sober dictates of our judgment.&nbsp; I think it has been shown
that the cause for action is strong&mdash;not for precipitate
action, not for action beyond our powers, but for such action as
the opportunities of the times and the condition of Parliament,
if there is a ready will, will amply and easily admit of.&nbsp;
If I am asked as to my expectations of the issue of this
struggle, I begin by frankly avowing that I, for one, would not
have entered into it unless I had believed that the final hour
<i>was</i> about to sound.&nbsp; &ldquo;Venit summa dies et
ineluctabile fatum.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I hope that the noble lord
will forgive me if I say that before last Friday I thought that
the thread of the remaining life of the Irish Established Church
was short, but that since Friday last, when at half-past four
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the noble lord stood at that
table, I have regarded it as being shorter still.&nbsp; The issue
is not in our hands.&nbsp; What we had and have to do is to
consider deeply and well before we take the first step in an
engagement such as this, but, having entered into the
controversy, there and then to acquit ourselves like men, and to
use every effort to remove what still remains of the scandals and
calamities in the relations that exist between England <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>and
Ireland, and to make our best efforts, at least, to fill up with
the cement of human concord the noble fabric of the British
Empire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone triumphed.&nbsp; Mr. Disraeli contented himself
with the victory of his great rival.&nbsp; Mr. M&lsquo;Cullagh
Torrens writes that he happened to pass near the Conservative
leader in the cloisters as he muffled to resist the outer air,
and could not help asking him what he thought of
Gladstone&rsquo;s speech in introducing the Bill.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;perfectly wonderful!&nbsp;
Nobody but himself could have gone through such a mass of
statistics, history, and computations.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then,
after a pause: &lsquo;And so characteristic in the finish to
throw away the surplus on the other idiots.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EDUCATION AND IRELAND.</span></h2>
<p>During the Educational debates Mr. Miall said that the Premier
had &lsquo;led one section of the Liberal party through the
valley of humiliation; but once bit, twice shy, and we
can&rsquo;t stand this sort of thing much longer.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Gladstone sharply replied: &lsquo;I hope that my hon. friend
will not continue his support of the Government one moment longer
than he deems it consistent with his sense of duty and
right.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake, sir, let him withdraw it the
moment he thinks it better for the cause he has at heart that he
should do so.&nbsp; So long as my hon. friend thinks fit to give
us his support, we will co-operate with my hon. friend for any
purpose we have in common, but when we think his opinions and
demands exacting, when we think that he looks too much to the
section of the community he adorns, and too little to the
interests of the people at large, we must then recollect that we
are the Government of the Queen, and that those who have assumed
the high responsibility of administering the affairs of the
empire must endeavour to forget the part in the whole, and must,
in the great measures they introduce into the House, propose to
themselves no meaner or narrower <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>object&mdash;no other object than
the welfare of the empire at large.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, in
opposing Mr. Miall&rsquo;s motion for doing to the English Church
what had been done to the Irish, he said: &lsquo;The Church of
England is not a foreign Church; it is the growth of the history
and traditions of the country.&nbsp; It is not the number of its
members or the millions of its revenue&mdash;it is the mode in
which it has been from a period shortly after the Christian era,
and has never for 1,300 years ceased to be, the Church of the
country, having been at every period engrained into the hearts
and feelings of the great mass of the people, and having entwined
itself with the local habits and feelings, so that I do not
believe there lives the man who could either divine the amount
and character of the work my honourable friend would have to
undertake were he doomed to be responsible for the execution of
his own propositions, or who could in the least degree define or
anticipate the consequences by which it would be attended.&nbsp;
If Mr. Miall sought to convert the majority of the House of
Commons to his views, he must begin by converting to his views
the opinions of the majority of the people of England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The attempt to carry an Irish University Bill led Mr.
Gladstone to resign.&nbsp; Mr. W. E. Forster writes:
&lsquo;Gladstone rose with the House dead against him, and made a
wonderful speech, easy&mdash;almost playful&mdash;with passages
of great power and eloquence, but with a graceful ease which
enabled him to plant daggers into Horsman, Fitzmaurice and
Co.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he writes: &lsquo;Gladstone determined to
resign; outside opinion very strongly for resignation.&nbsp;
Gladstone made quite a touching little speech; he began
playfully.&nbsp; This was <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the last of a hundred Cabinets, and
he wished to say to his colleagues with what profound
gratitude&mdash;and then he broke down, and could only say that
he would not enter on the details.&nbsp; Tears came into my eyes,
and we were all very touched.&rsquo;&nbsp; As Mr. Disraeli was
unable to form a Government, Mr. Gladstone, however, soon
returned to power, he resuming his old place as Chancellor of the
Exchequer.&nbsp; Touching the Irish University Bill, Lord
Blachford writes: &lsquo;Coleridge is sanguine about
Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish University Bill.&nbsp; He seems to have
started with the Cabinet against him, and to have converted them
all (their point being, I suppose, to have something that would
<i>pass</i>), especially some whom Coleridge describes as full of
admiration for the scheme.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand it, but
I imagine that it gives or leaves to everybody enough to stop
their mouths without infuriating their neighbours.&rsquo;&nbsp;
As stated, Mr. Gladstone returned to office, only to leave it in
the following year, when he dissolved Parliament and the Tories
had a majority.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone retained his seat for
Greenwich, but a local Tory was at the head of the poll.</p>
<p>Lord Russell&rsquo;s charges against Mr. Gladstone of
indifference on colonial questions is somewhat borne out by his
conduct with regard to the annexation of Fiji, which he opposed
in 1873, but which was ultimately carried out by the Government
that succeeded his in the following year.&nbsp; In reply to Sir
W. M&rsquo;Arthur&rsquo;s motion in the House for the annexation
of Fiji, Mr. Gladstone said: &lsquo;Nothing was easier than to
make out a plausible case of appropriation of this kind, and yet
nothing would so much excite the displeasure of those who cheered
his honourable friend <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>the member for Lambeth, than when
for such appropriations a similar disposition was shown by other
countries.&nbsp; It might be the chill of old age that was coming
upon him, but he confessed he did not feel that excitement for
the acquisition of new territory which animated the hon.
gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; As to commerce, with our inability
&lsquo;to cope with expanding opportunities, he did not feel the
pressure of the argument for securing special guarantees for our
trade in every part of the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was more
discursive in replying to what he called, &lsquo;in no taunting
spirit, the philanthropic part of the question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing was more unexpected, or, as it happened, nothing more
disastrous, than Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s sudden dissolution of
Parliament in 1874.&nbsp; Mr. M&rsquo;Cullagh Torrens writes:
&lsquo;On January 24 I was amused at breakfast by a paragraph
read by one of my family&mdash;which, in the profundity of
legislative wisdom, I treated as an editorial
jest&mdash;announcing an immediate dissolution.&nbsp; When
convinced at last by reference to an address to Greenwich that
the decree had really gone forth, my breath was again taken away
by learning that the immediate cause was the authoritative
confession that the Cabinet had lost the necessary influence in
directing public opinion, and that the new departure requisite
for its recovery consisted in the offer to abolish the
income-tax, and the creation of a number of peasant boroughs
instead of those which might be still spared as belonging to the
upper classes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Chamberlain severely described
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s address containing these proposals as
&lsquo;the meanest public document which had ever in like
circumstances proceeded from a statesman of the first
rank.&rsquo;&nbsp; It fell flat on the public.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>In
1875 Mr. Gladstone, to the surprise of his friends, announced his
determination to retire from the leadership of his party, and the
Marquis of Hartington was selected in his stead, and held that
post until the end of the session of 1879.&nbsp; The situation
was a little embarrassing.&nbsp; The difficulties he had to
encounter as leader of a minority in the House of Commons were
enormously increased by the fact that he had to deal, not merely
with his followers, but with his brilliant predecessor, who could
at any moment, by his own individual action, lead the Liberal
party into any course in which he chose to direct them.</p>
<p>Continuing his career as a reformer, we find Mr. Gladstone
repealing the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and abolishing
religious tests in the Universities; and as the Lords threw out
his Bill for the Abolition of Purchase in the Army, he abolished
it by Royal Warrant.&nbsp; Many old Whigs questioned the wisdom
of the procedure, as they did also his conduct in the
<i>Alabama</i> Claims, which he referred to arbitration, when, as
is always the case, the arbitrators decided against us and in
favour of America.&nbsp; Earl Russell, who has a claim to be
heard on the question, writes that he declined to submit the
claims to arbitration by a foreign Power because &lsquo;it
appeared to me that we could not consistently with our position
as an independent State allow a foreign Power to decide either
that Great Britain had been wanting in good faith or that our law
officers did not understand so well as a foreign Power or State
the meaning of a British statute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His lordship severely criticised the way in which Mr.
Gladstone formed his Ministry, as done with little tact or
discrimination.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot think,&rsquo; he continues,
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&lsquo;that I was mistaken in giving way to Mr.
Gladstone as head of the Whig-Radical party of England.&nbsp;
During Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s Ministry I had every reason to
admire the boldness and the judgment with which he had directed
our finances.&nbsp; I had no reason to suppose that he was less
attached than I was to our national honour; that he was less
proud than I was of our national achievements by land or sea;
that he disliked the extension of our colonies; or that his
measures would tend to reduce the great and glorious empire of
which he was put in charge to a manufactory of cheap cloth and a
market for cheap goods, with an army and navy reduced by paltry
savings to a standard of weakness and inefficiency.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In March, 1874, Mr. Gladstone addressed a letter to Lord
Granville, in which he said: &lsquo;At my age I must reserve my
entire freedom to divest myself of all the responsibilities of
leadership at no distant date. . . .&nbsp; I should be desirous
shortly before the season of 1874 to consider whether there would
not be an advantage in my placing my services for a time at the
disposal of the Liberal party, or whether I should claim
exemption from the duties I have hitherto
discharged.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone at that time was
sixty-four&mdash;certainly no great age for himself or any other
statesman of his time; and when Mr. Russell Gurney proposed to
legislate on Ritualism, Mr. Gladstone was back in the
field.&nbsp; After his unsuccessful intervention, Mr. Gladstone
again retired from active participation in affairs; but he
returned to the subject in the autumn by contributing an article
to the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, in which he passionately
protested against the attempt to impose uniformity of practice on
the clergy of the <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Church of England by legislation.&nbsp; In the
following passage he did much to offend the Roman Catholics:
&lsquo;As to the question whether a handful of clergy are or are
not engaged in an utterly hopeless and visionary attempt to
Romanize the Church and the people of England, at no time since
the bloody reign of Queen Mary has such a scheme been
possible.&nbsp; But if it had been possible in the seventeenth or
eighteenth centuries, it would still have become impossible in
the nineteenth, when Rome has substituted for the proud boast of
<i>semper eadem</i> a policy of violence and change in faith;
when she has refurbished every rusty weapon she was fondly
thought to have disused; when no one can become her convert
without renouncing his mental and moral freedom, and placing his
civil loyalty and duty at the mercy of another; and when she has
equally repudiated modern thought and ancient
history.&rsquo;&nbsp; This article was followed up by his
celebrated pamphlet, &lsquo;The Vatican Decrees in their bearing
on Civil Allegiance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ministers had an easy time of it till they got to the purchase
of the shares in the Suez Canal, which Mr. Gladstone vehemently
opposed, though it seems to have turned out well.&nbsp; When Mr.
Gladstone declared that it was an unprecedented thing to spend
the money of the nation in that way, Sir Stafford Northcote
replied: &lsquo;So is the canal.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone was
soon to prove how far from real was his intention of retiring
into private life.&nbsp; We began to hear of Bulgarian atrocities
and of the Turkish horrors.&nbsp; It was a cause into which Mr.
Gladstone threw himself heart and soul.&nbsp; He published an
article in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, advocating the
expulsion of &lsquo;the unspeakable Turk,&rsquo; bag and <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>baggage,
from the country.&nbsp; His pamphlets were in every hand.&nbsp;
In the meanwhile we had another crisis in the East.&nbsp; We were
on the verge of war with Russia, and the Jingoes, as the war
party came to be denominated, went about the streets singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to fight; but, by
Jingo! if we do,<br />
We&rsquo;ve got the ships, we&rsquo;ve got the men, we&rsquo;ve
got the money too!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Disraeli had sought refuge in the House of Lords as Earl
Beaconsfield.&nbsp; All this time Mr. Gladstone kept rather quiet
in Parliament, but from time to time he addressed meetings in the
country, denouncing the Jingoes.&nbsp; We find him, however,
supporting a vote of censure on the Government, moved by Lord
Hartington, he himself having already moved one.&nbsp; It was a
false move in tactics, as the Government obtained a crushing
majority.&nbsp; But the Ministry were doomed, nevertheless.&nbsp;
At the General Election in 1880 they had a decisive defeat,
mainly due to Mr. Gladstone, who had gone to Scotland to win
Midlothian, hitherto the stronghold of the Duke of Buccleugh, and
who had carried the fiery cross in triumph from London to the
North.&nbsp; Never had he exerted himself more, and never with
such splendid results.&nbsp; As Mr. Disraeli had said when
referring to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s temporary retirement from
political life, &lsquo;There will be a return from Elba;&rsquo;
nor was that return long delayed.&nbsp; Once more he was
Premier.</p>
<p>But there was a difficulty.&nbsp; At the time of the victory
Lord Hartington, not Mr. Gladstone, was the leader of the Liberal
party.&nbsp; When Lord Beaconsfield resigned, which he had the
grace to do without meeting Parliament, the Queen, according to
precedent, sent for Lord Hartington.&nbsp; He could do nothing,
and <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>then
the Queen summoned Lord Granville, the Liberal leader in the
Lords.&nbsp; The two statesmen went together to the Queen, and
assured her that the victory was Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s, and that
he was the only possible Premier.&nbsp; They returned to London
in the afternoon, and called upon Mr. Gladstone in Harley
Street.&nbsp; He was expecting the message which they brought,
and he went down to Windsor without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp;
This was on April 23.&nbsp; That evening he kissed hands and
returned to London, a second time Premier.&nbsp; The prospect was
not cheering.&nbsp; On a vote on the Bradlaugh affair the
Government majority was seventy-five.&nbsp; There were
difficulties about Sir Bartle Frere at the Cape, about Cyprus,
about the Employers&rsquo; Liability Bill, and a hot debate on
opium.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gladstone,&rsquo; writes Sir Stafford
Northcote, &lsquo;had been dining out to meet the authoress of
&ldquo;Sister Dora&rdquo; (Miss Lonsdale), who was very much
alarmed by the rapidity and variety of his questions, and only
came back in time to express his opinion that the House was too
much influenced by sentiment and too little by judgment.&nbsp; It
must be as good as a play to hear such sentiments from such a
quarter.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the course of one of the debates on the
Bradlaugh affair, Sir Stafford Northcote writes: &lsquo;Gladstone
spoke early, and evidently under great anxiety.&nbsp; His speech,
especially in the earlier part, was a very fine one, and produced
a considerable impression.&nbsp; Towards the end, however, he
refined too much, and seemed a little to lose his hold of his
audience.&nbsp; Gibson followed him with a very able and telling
speech, but, unfortunately, the House had greatly emptied for
dinner when Mr. Gladstone sat down.&nbsp; It is a favourite habit
of his to speak into the dinner-hour, <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>so that his opponent must speak
either to empty benches or forego the advantage of replying on
the instant.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Opposition when the division was
taken had a majority of forty-four, &lsquo;a result,&rsquo; adds
Sir Stafford Northcote, &lsquo;wholly unexpected on our side, the
more sanguine having only hoped for a close run, and being
prepared to renew the fight by moving the previous question, and
adjourning the debate on it.&nbsp; The excitement when the
numbers were given was greater than I ever remember.&nbsp; There
was shouting, cheering, clapping of hands, and other
demonstrations, both louder and longer than any I ever heard in
my Parliamentary life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be stated that ultimately the question of Bradlaugh was
settled by Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s moving a resolution to admit all
persons who may claim their right to do so, without question and
subject to their liability to penalties by the State.</p>
<p>When the new Parliament assembled the Liberals were in a
majority of more than a hundred, if the Irish Home Rulers were
counted as neutral.&nbsp; If they were added to the Liberal
ranks, their majority became 170.&nbsp; No one then thought of
adding them to the Conservatives, though half of them&mdash;the
Parnellites&mdash;subsequently voted with the Conservatives in a
vast number of divisions, and finally contributed to Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
<h2><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IRELAND UNDER MR. FORSTER.</span></h2>
<p>When Mr. Gladstone returned to power, Mr. Forster was
appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, with Lord Cowper as
Viceroy.&nbsp; There was great distress&mdash;as there generally
is in Ireland&mdash;and exceptional efforts had been made, both
by the Government and the people of this country, to meet
it.&nbsp; A benevolent fund had been raised, chiefly through the
influence of the Duchess of Marlborough, wife of the
Lord-Lieutenant, and a Distress Relief Act had been carried by
Parliament to empower the application of three-quarters of a
million of the Irish Church Surplus Fund, and some good had
unquestionably been done by the public and private effort thus
made to relieve distress; but it was clear, from the results of
the elections, and from the speeches of the popular Irish
leaders, that it was not to measures of this kind that the people
looked for permanent relief.&nbsp; The unusual distress of 1879
had intensified and aggravated the chronic disaffection, and
sixty members had been returned to Parliament who were pledged to
do their utmost to put an end to English rule in Ireland by
securing Home Rule.&nbsp; Flushed with the brilliant success they
had achieved, <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>the Liberal party entered upon office confident that a
career of prosperity lay before them.&nbsp; Lord
Beaconsfield&rsquo;s defeat had been brought about by the
national repudiation of his foreign policy; and, in the first
instance, it was of foreign, rather than domestic, affairs that
the new House of Commons was thinking.&nbsp; But Ireland at once
came to the front.&nbsp; The existing Coercion Act would expire
in a few weeks, and it was necessary to secure its renewal before
it lapsed; but the Cabinet resolved to try the experiment of
governing by means of the ordinary law.</p>
<p>The Lords threw out Mr. Forster&rsquo;s measures intended to
relieve Ireland.&nbsp; He did not scruple to avow his vexation
and resentment at their summary rejection, and the dangerous
effect it would have in the disturbed districts during the coming
winter, which might lead to the adoption of much stronger
measures, both of concession and coercion, than the Government
had hitherto attempted.&nbsp; In response, Mr. Parnell, in
addressing a great audience at Ennis, enunciated the plan already
known as boycotting, whereby every man who took an evicted farm,
and everyone who aided or abetted eviction, should be shunned as
a leper in the fair, refused custom in the market, and treated as
an intruder at the altar.&nbsp; Before the year was out the
courts established by the Land League publicly heard and
determined the merits of each case as it arose.&nbsp; The signal
for acts of summary violence was set by the fate of Lord
Mountmorres, who had incurred popular dislike by his conduct as a
rigorous magistrate, and was put to death on the highway near his
own house in open daylight.&nbsp; Mr. Forster early proposed to
suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, and to prosecute the prominent <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>movers of
the agitation.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone clung to the hope that the
friends of law and order would combine to suppress the tendencies
to outrage, and wished to defer as long as possible the
suspension of constitutional freedom; but ere Parliament had
reassembled in 1881, the progress of disorder and outrage had
increased, and the Cabinet reluctantly authorized the
introduction of a measure for the protection of life and
property.&nbsp; Twenty-two nights were spent in debating it; but
it was passed by an overwhelming majority, comprising
Ministerialists, Radicals, and Conservatives.&nbsp; But the
obstruction systematically offered to repressive legislation at
last provoked Speaker Brand to assert a discretionary power of
terminating debate, which led to the introduction of a change of
procedure, of which the most prominent measure was the
Cl&ocirc;ture.</p>
<p>The Irish Land Bill was the chief work of the session of
1881.&nbsp; Mr. Forster&rsquo;s work at this time was arduous and
untiring to keep the Cabinet up to duty.&nbsp; In October, 1881,
Mr. Gladstone writes from Hawarden: &lsquo;Your sad and saddening
letter supplies much food for serious reflection; but I need not
reply at great length, mainly because I practically agree with
you.&nbsp; I almost take for granted, and I shall assume until
you correct me, that your meaning about ruin to property is as
follows: You do not mean the ruin to property which may directly
result from exclusive dealing, but you mean ruin to property by
violence&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, burning of a man&rsquo;s haystack
because he had let his cars on hire to the constabulary.&nbsp; On
this assumption I feel politically quite prepared to concur with
you in acting upon legal advice to this effect; nor do I dissent,
under the circumstances, from the series of propositions by which
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>you seek
to connect Parnell and Co. with the prevalent intimidation.&nbsp;
But I hardly think that so novel an application of the Protection
Act should be undertaken without the Cabinet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same month Mr. Gladstone went to Leeds, where he had a
reception which exceeded all expectations.&nbsp; In his speech he
devoted himself to the Irish Question.&nbsp; Amidst enthusiastic
cheers from the vast audience, he pointed to Mr. Forster&rsquo;s
name, and spoke in generous terms of the arduous and painful task
in which he was then engaged; and then he went on in clear and
forcible language to denounce the conduct of Mr. Parnell and of
the other Land League leaders in striving to stand between the
people of Ireland and the Land Act, in order that the beneficial
effects of that measure might not be allowed to reach them.&nbsp;
Such conduct, Mr. Gladstone declared, would not be
tolerated.&nbsp; &lsquo;The resources of civilization
were,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;not exhausted.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
followed the arrest of Mr. Parnell.&nbsp; Within twelve hours the
news was spread over the civilized world, and everywhere it
created a great sensation.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, speaking at a
meeting at the Guildhall on the same day, first announced the
fact of Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s arrest to the people of England, and
the statement was received with an enthusiastic outburst that
startled even the speaker himself.&nbsp; It was hailed as if it
were the news of a signal victory.&nbsp; Throughout England the
belief&mdash;so soon to be dissipated&mdash;was held that the
imprisonment of Mr. Parnell at Kilmainham must mean the downfall
of his authority, and the extinction of the great organization of
which he was the head; in reality, the outrages and
assassinations became greater.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>One
result was a change in the policy of the Government.&nbsp; The
English public was asked to believe that the Irish policy of the
Government was not the policy of Mr. Gladstone, but of Mr.
Forster alone.&nbsp; On March 24, 1882, Mr. Gladstone wrote to
Mr. Forster, who was then in Dublin, pointing out to him the
growing opposition to the Ministerial proposals for instituting
the Closure, and the prevalent belief among the Irish members in
the House that by stopping the Closure they might prevent the
renewal of the Protection Act.&nbsp; The Prime Minister added
&lsquo;that, with the Land Act working briskly, resistance to
process disappearing, and rents increasingly and even generally,
though not uniformly, paid, a renewal of so odious a power as
that we now hold <i>is</i> impossible, and that whatever may be
needed by way of supplement to the ordinary law must be found in
other forms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parnell, speaking at Wexford on October 10, 1881, said:
&lsquo;He (Mr. Gladstone) would have you believe that he is not
afraid of you, because he has disarmed you, because he has
attempted to disorganize you, because he knows that the Irish
nation is to-day disarmed as far as physical weapons go, but he
does not hold this kind of language with the Boers (cheers for
the Boers.&nbsp; A Voice: &lsquo;We will be Boers
too!&rsquo;).&nbsp; What did he do at the commencement of the
session?&nbsp; He said something of this kind with regard to the
Boers.&nbsp; He said that he was going to put them down, and as
soon as he discovered that they were able to shoot straighter
than his own soldiers, he allowed those few men to put him and
his Government down, and although he has attempted to regain some
of his lost position in the Transvaal by subsequent chicanery and
<a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>diplomatic negotiations, yet that sturdy and small
people in the distant Transvaal have seen through William Ewart
Gladstone; and they have told him again, for the second time,
that they will not have their liberties filched from them; and I
believe that, as a result, we shall see that William Ewart
Gladstone will again yield to the people of the Transvaal (hear,
hear).&nbsp; And I trust that, as the result of this great
movement, we shall see that, just as Gladstone by the Act of 1881
has eaten all his old words, has departed from all his formerly
declared principles, now we shall see that these brave words of
this English Prime Minister will be scattered as chaff before the
united and advancing determination of the Irish people to regain
for themselves their lost land and their lost legislative
independence (loud and continued cheering).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Parnell termed him a hoary-headed old miscreant; Miss
Helen Taylor, of the London School Board, described him as a
dastard and a recreant; Mr. O&rsquo;Donnell, M.P., said Gladstone
was a Judas, who had betrayed Ireland by the kiss of peace to the
persecutor and tormentor.&nbsp; In Philadelphia, the City of
Brotherly Love, the effigy of Mr. Gladstone was burned by a crowd
of fifteen hundred Irish under the direction of the League
leaders.&nbsp; Even in Hawarden the magistrates had to place four
additional constables to protect Mr. Gladstone from the effects
of Irish revenge.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, said Mr. Parnell at
Wexford just before he was arrested, was the greatest
coercionist, the greatest and most unrivalled slanderer of the
Irish nation, that ever lived.</p>
<p>The situation was gloomy.&nbsp; Naturally Mr. Gladstone made
as light as possible of the situation in the speech <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>he
delivered at the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s banquet.&nbsp; The speech for
the moment silenced the murmurs of dissension inside the
Cabinet.&nbsp; &lsquo;You said,&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone wrote to
Forster, &lsquo;that if we are to ask for a suspension of Habeas
Corpus, it must be on a case of great strength and
clearness.&nbsp; But do these figures, after all the allowance to
be made for protection, indicate such a case?&nbsp; As far as I
can judge, there is a tendency in Ireland upon a series of years
to a decline in the total number of homicides.&nbsp; The immense
increase in property offences, agrarian, for 1880 seems to me to
mark the true character of the crisis and the true source of the
mischief of the Land League.&nbsp; But I incline to assume that
any suspension of Habeas Corpus must be founded on danger to
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Parliament met in 1881 began the long running fight
between Mr. Forster and Mr. Parnell.&nbsp; As the chief
representative of the Land League, Mr. Parnell had spoken
defending the action of the League, and Mr. Forster retorted that
the meetings of that body had constantly been followed by
outrage, and that the object of the Land Leaguers was not to
bring about an alteration in the law of the land by
constitutional means, but to prevent any payment of rent save
such as might be in accordance with the unwritten law of Mr.
Parnell.&nbsp; In Parliament Government carried a Protection Act,
an Arms Bill, and an Irish Land Bill.&nbsp; The Acts were of no
avail.&nbsp; Outrages increased after the passing of the
Protection Act.&nbsp; In May Mr. John Dillon was arrested and
others of his party.&nbsp; In September it was resolved to arrest
Mr. Parnell, &lsquo;the uncrowned king,&rsquo; as his followers
called him.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone assented to the arrest if in the
<a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>opinion
of the law officers of the Crown he had by his speeches been
guilty of treasonable practices.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when Mr. Forster had suggested that he had
better retire, Mr. Gladstone wrote by return of post to
acknowledge &lsquo;the very grave letter,&rsquo; which he thought
ought to be laid before the Cabinet.&nbsp; &lsquo;With regard to
your leaving Ireland,&rsquo; wrote the Prime Minister,
&lsquo;there is an analogy between your position and mine.&nbsp;
Virtually abandoning the hope of vital change for the better, I
come on my own behalf to an anticipation projected a little
further into the future&mdash;that after the winter things may
mend, and that my own retirement may give facilities for the
fulfilment of your very natural desire.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in a
day or two after this Mr. Gladstone congratulated Forster upon
the manner in which he had accomplished a difficult and delicate
task in connection with the Irish Executive.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
not every man,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;who in difficult
circumstances can keep a cool head with a warm heart&mdash;and
that is what you are doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1882 the situation in Ireland became increasingly difficult
and dangerous.&nbsp; As the time drew near for the meeting of
Parliament, it was evident that the session would be a stormy
one.&nbsp; In all quarters attacks upon the Chief Secretary
seemed to be in course of preparation.&nbsp; The Protection Act
had not put an end to the outrages, despite the fact that
hundreds of prisoners, including Mr. Parnell and other members of
Parliament, were under lock and key.&nbsp; Above all, the
Protection Act would expire during the year, and consequently
Ministers must allow it to expire, or must ask Parliament to
spend weeks, or possibly months, in renewing it.&nbsp; Yet in the
Queen&rsquo;s Speech it was stated <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>that the condition of Ireland showed
signs of improvement, and encouraged the hope that perseverance
in the course hitherto pursued would be rewarded with the happy
results which were so much to be desired.&nbsp; The Lords
resolved to find fault with the working of the Land Act.&nbsp;
The challenge of the Lords was taken up by the Government in the
House of Commons, and a resolution moved by Mr. Gladstone, that
any inquiry at that time into the working of the Land Act would
defeat its operation, and must be injurious to the interests of
good government in Ireland, was carried by a majority of 303 to
235.</p>
<p>After the Easter recess the attacks on Forster were
renewed.&nbsp; It was demanded that he should be removed from
office, and that the suspects should be immediately released, on
the plea that their imprisonment had not prevented the
continuance of the outrages.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the
American Government became urgent in their demands for the
release of those prisoners who could prove that they were
citizens of the United States, while, in addition to the
political perplexities thus created, the atrocious murder of Mrs.
H. J. Smythe, as she was driving home from church in West Meath,
sent a thrill of horror through the country.&nbsp; At this time
Forster, in a letter to Mr. Gladstone, writes: &lsquo;That if now
or at any future time&rsquo; (the <i>Pall Mall</i> had been
suggesting his resignation) &lsquo;you think that from <i>any
cause</i> it would be to the advantage of the public service or
for the good of Ireland that I should resign, I most unreservedly
place my resignation in your hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In reply, Mr. Gladstone wrote from Hawarden, April 5, 1882:
&lsquo;Yesterday morning I was unwell, <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and did not
see the papers, so that I have only just become aware of the
obliging suggestion that you should retire.&nbsp; I suspect it is
partly due to a few (not many) Tory eulogies.&nbsp; There is one
consideration which grievously tempts me towards the acceptance
of the offer conveyed in your most handsome letter.&nbsp; It is
that if you go, and go on Irish grounds, surely I must go too. .
. .&nbsp; We must continue to face our difficulties with an
unbroken front and with a stout heart.&nbsp; I do not admit your
failure, and I think you have admitted it rather too
much&mdash;at any rate, by omission&mdash;by not putting forward
the main fact that in the deadly fight with the social revolution
you have not failed, but are succeeding.&nbsp; Your failure, were
it true, is our failure; and outrage, though a grave fact, is not
the main one.&nbsp; Were there a change in the features of the
case, I would not hesitate to recognise it, with whatever pain,
as unreservedly as I now record their actual condition.&nbsp; I
do not suppose we ought to think of legislating on the Irish case
until after Whitsuntide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, Mr. Forster did resign.&nbsp; In April Lord
Spencer succeeded Earl Cowper as Irish Viceroy, and negotiations
were carried on between Captain O&rsquo;Shea and Mr.
Parnell&mdash;known now as the Kilmainham Treaty&mdash;of which
Mr. Forster strongly complained.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone took a
different view.&nbsp; Writing to Forster, he expressed the
satisfaction with which he had read Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s
letter.&nbsp; With regard to the expression in the letter of the
writer&rsquo;s willingness to co-operate in future with the
Liberal party, Mr. Gladstone wrote: &lsquo;This is a <i>hors
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> which we had no right to expect.&nbsp; I
may be far wide <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>of the mark, but I can scarcely wonder at O&rsquo;Shea
saying, &ldquo;The thing is done. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
whole, Parnell&rsquo;s letter is the most extraordinary I ever
read.&nbsp; I cannot help feeling indebted to
O&rsquo;Shea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In May Mr. Forster resigned.&nbsp; Writing on the 2nd of that
month, Mr. Gladstone, in reply, says: &lsquo;I have received your
letter with much grief, but on this it would be selfish to
expatiate.&nbsp; I have no choice&mdash;followed or not followed,
I must go on. . . .&nbsp; One thing, however, I wish to
say.&nbsp; You wish to minimize in any public statement the cause
of your retreat.&nbsp; In my opinion, <i>and I speak from
experience</i>, viewing the nature of the case, you will find
this hardly possible.&nbsp; For a justification, I fear, you will
have to found upon the doctrine of a new departure, or must
protest against it and deny it with heart and soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of the parting, Mr. Forster told his biographer that
he had learned not merely to esteem, but to love Mr. Gladstone
during their intercourse as colleagues, and he bore testimony to
the fact that he had never ceased to be supported by him until
the moment came when the Prime Minister found reason to change
his policy.&nbsp; Then, however, the change of policy was swiftly
followed by a change of attitude, so far as politics were
concerned, deplored by both men, but, under the circumstances,
inevitable.</p>
<p>Lord Frederick Cavendish was gazetted as Mr. Forster&rsquo;s
successor.&nbsp; He arrived in Dublin on May 6.&nbsp; On that day
he and Mr. Burke, the Irish Under-Secretary, were foully murdered
while crossing the Ph&oelig;nix Park by a band of assassins,
whose plans, it was evident, had been laid long beforehand with
the utmost deliberation.&nbsp; Mr. Forster had escaped <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>them on his
departure from Dublin by what almost seemed a miracle.&nbsp; In a
few days after, Sir William Harcourt introduced into the House of
Commons a new Coercion Bill, which, although it was laid upon the
lines introduced by Mr. Forster before he retired from office,
was in many respects more severe and stringent in its character
than anything which he had proposed.</p>
<p>Another difficulty which beset the Government was the
occupation of Egypt in 1882.&nbsp; The bombardment of Alexandria
led to the retirement of Mr. Bright from the Cabinet.&nbsp; Many
Liberals were profoundly dissatisfied.&nbsp; In the early part of
the session of 1883, the question of our obligations in South
Africa, and our duties towards native chiefs who had trusted in
our promises, arose in connection with Bechuanaland.&nbsp; In
domestic politics the question was that of the Household Suffrage
Bill, which, carried in the Commons, was thrown out in the House
of Lords.</p>
<p>But a greater question was that of the abandonment of the
Soudan and the failure to relieve Gordon at Khartoum.&nbsp; It
was in the course of one of his most urgent appeals to Government
not to delay the sending out of an expedition that Forster used
words respecting Mr. Gladstone which were strangely
misinterpreted at the time.&nbsp; Speaking of the dangers of
Gordon&rsquo;s position, he said: &lsquo;I believe everyone but
the Prime Minister is already convinced of that danger . . . and
I attribute his not being convinced to his wonderful power of
persuasion.&nbsp; He can persuade most people of most things, and
above all, he can persuade himself of almost
anything.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is difficult now to realize that these
words were resented by Lord Hartington as &lsquo;a <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>bitter and
personal, and evidently highly-prepared and long-reflected-over,
attack upon the sincerity of Mr. Gladstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to
be remembered that at this time Mr. Bright had resigned office,
and the Government was daily growing weaker.&nbsp; The attack of
the Tories was incessant, and the supporters of the Government
became daily more faint-hearted.&nbsp; It is said of one of our
months that it comes in like a lion and goes out like a
lamb.&nbsp; In the present instance this was specially true of
the Gladstone Government.&nbsp; In June, 1883, the Government
were beaten on the Budget.&nbsp; In reference to this event Lord
Shaftesbury writes: &lsquo;I have just seen the defeat of
Government on the Budget by Conservatives and Parnellites
combined; an act of folly amounting to wickedness.&nbsp; God is
not in all their thoughts, nor their country either.&nbsp; All
seek their own, and their own is party spirit, momentary triumph,
political hatred, and the indulgence of low political and
unpatriotic passions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A more accurate observer, &lsquo;I rather fancy,&rsquo; wrote
Mr. W. H. Smith, M.P., &lsquo;the Government look for it as a
relief from their troubles.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last, and perhaps
the most serious of all, was the manner in which they had allowed
themselves to be outwitted by Russia in Afghanistan.&nbsp; This
belief was generally entertained all over the land.&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone was glad to put an end to his perplexities by resigning
office.&nbsp; The Queen offered to make him an Earl, which he had
too much sense to accept&mdash;though in office no one was more
ready to make peers of his friends.&nbsp; In his later years his
trump card was an attack on the House of Lords.&nbsp; Lord
Salisbury became Premier, all necessary business was quickly
disposed of, and in the autumn a General <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Election
took place.&nbsp; In the boroughs the Liberal losses were heavy;
in the counties they increased their strength.&nbsp; One of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s appeals to the country was sounded in his
speech at Edinburgh to the electors of Midlothian.&nbsp; He
passionately implored his party to hold together, in order, above
all things, that they should return a Liberal majority so
considerable as to make it independent of the Irish party.&nbsp;
He expressed the hope that from one end of the country to the
other there would not be a single representative returned to
Parliament who would listen to any proposition tending to impair
the visible empire.&nbsp; Whatever demands might be made on the
part of Ireland, if they were to be entertained they must be
subject to the condition that the union of the empire should be
preserved.&nbsp; Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s answer was to return
eighty-six Home-Rulers for Ireland; Lord Salisbury remained
Premier.&nbsp; Lord Shaftesbury wrote: &lsquo;In a year or so we
shall have Home Rule disposed of at all hazards to save us from
hourly and daily bores.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the meanwhile the
Conservatives held feebly to office till 1886, when in January
Mr. Gladstone resumed office as Premier.</p>
<h2><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HOME RULE.</span></h2>
<p>About this time Home Rule began seriously to be talked
about.&nbsp; It was even hinted that Mr. Gladstone was about to
bring in a measure on the subject.&nbsp; In some quarters it was
hinted the Conservatives would outbid him in their eagerness to
obtain Irish support.&nbsp; Men who belonged to no party could
not bring themselves to regard any measure of Home Rule
seriously, especially when they saw how by means of it Irish
M.P.&rsquo;s had gained a popularity and a position which
otherwise they would never have hoped to attain.&nbsp; An Irish
Nationalist had everything to lose by means of a peaceful
solution of Irish difficulties&mdash;his claim on the funds
collected largely in America, his place in Parliament, his
position on the public platform.&nbsp; As long as he could teach
his ignorant fellow-countrymen and sympathizing Americans that
England was the sworn foe of Ireland and did all she could to
crush her and keep her down, he had an easy time of it.&nbsp; To
abuse England was to play an easy part, and no misrepresentation
was too absurd to be put forth to arouse Irish hatred&mdash;on
which the Catholic priests naturally looked with no unfriendly
eyes.&nbsp; For England was a <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>country rich and prosperous and
Protestant, and they dared not tell the Irish people that if they
copied England Ireland would be as prosperous as any part of
Great Britain.&nbsp; Take the case of Mr. Forster, savagely
execrated as &lsquo;Buckshot&rsquo; Forster.&nbsp; Why was he
held up to hatred under that name?&nbsp; Simply for the reason
that buckshot not being so fatal as bullets, Mr. Forster had
recommended it to the troops in case they should be obliged to
resort to arms.&nbsp; The plain Englishman, aware how for fifty
years Parliament had been trying to pacify Ireland and to remove
wrong where it was admitted to exist, who heard Irishmen declare
that they were at war with England, could not be expected
strongly to support a movement in favour of Home Rule, especially
after Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s appeal to him to give him a majority
independent of the Irish vote.</p>
<p>Many prejudices had to be overcome.&nbsp; As a rule, the
Englishman has slight confidence in Irish oratory.&nbsp; An
amusing illustration of its tendency to run into exaggeration is
given by that sturdy Irish patriot Mr. John O&rsquo;Neill Daunt,
who in 1882 thus closes his diary for the year: &lsquo;The year
now ending has been blackened by most abominable crimes and
murders.&nbsp; Parnell and his followers acquired vast popularity
by denouncing the evictors, the extortioners, the rack-renters;
had they stopped there they would have merited praise.&nbsp; But
in attacking all landlords&mdash;good and bad
landlords&mdash;they fatally widened that severance of classes
which has always been the curse of Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Unprejudiced Englishmen&mdash;not excited by hope of triumph
for a party&mdash;were naturally sceptical about Home Rule for
Ireland.&nbsp; The masses were quite content to follow Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s lead, and to applaud <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>the Irish
orators who from time to time appeared in their midst.&nbsp; As a
nation, the Irish are oratorical and poetical.&nbsp; It is by
poetry and oratory the Irishman makes his way in the world, and
wins fame and fortune; while the Saxon is content to make a
fortune by honest industry and commercial enterprise.&nbsp; An
Irish poet&mdash;one of the most popular of them
perhaps&mdash;who is more honoured in England than in the land of
his birth, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Of all the ills that men endure,<br />
How small the part that laws can heal or cure.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they are content to plod on, while the Irishman revels in
the excitement of agitation.&nbsp; But Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s new
policy was to put down agitation, to satisfy his Irish
supporters, and to send another message of peace to Ireland by
carrying a measure of Home Rule.&nbsp; His initial difficulty was
with his Cabinet.&nbsp; The Marquis of Hartington, Lord Derby,
Lord Selborne stood aloof, Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan
remaining with him.&nbsp; Early in the session Mr. Gladstone
announced that he hoped to be able to lay before the House his
plan for the future government of Ireland.&nbsp; Sir Stafford
Northcote saw dangers ahead.&nbsp; In a speech he made at
Aberdeen, he said of his old leader: &lsquo;I am prepared from a
long acquaintance with him, both as a friend and as an opponent
in Parliament, to bear the highest tribute to the great ability
of the late Premier; at the same time, I think he is about the
most dangerous statesman I know. . . .&nbsp; It always seems to
me that the worst sign of bad weather is when you see the new
moon with what is called the old moon in its arms.&nbsp; I have
no doubt that many of you Aberdeen men have read the fine old
ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>who was drowned some twenty or
thirty miles to the east of Aberdeen.&nbsp; In that ballad he was
cautioned not to go to sea, because his old and weatherwise
attendant had noticed the new moon with the old moon in its
lap.&nbsp; I think myself that is a very dangerous sign; and when
I see Mr. Chamberlain with Mr. Gladstone, the old moon, in his
arms, I think it is time to look out for squally
weather.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Squally weather it was at any rate the misfortune of Mr.
Gladstone to encounter in his new endeavour.&nbsp; There was at
this time no one in the ranks of the Opposition at all
approaching Lord Randolph Churchill in force and vigour as an
orator; and in a speech delivered in Manchester he made an
eloquent appeal to Liberals to join with Conservatives in forming
a new political party, which he named &lsquo;Unionist,&rsquo; to
combine all that is best of the Tory, the Whig, and the
Liberal.</p>
<p>In the interval of suspense which preceded Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s declaration as to his Irish scheme, there was
no ambiguity in the utterances of the Whig leaders, and he was
made perfectly aware that if his Bill would confer a practically
independent legislature on Ireland, he must prepare for
opposition not only from them and the Tories, but also from Mr.
Chamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan, his colleagues in the
Cabinet.&nbsp; In March it was announced that they had
resigned.</p>
<p>On April 8, 1886, Mr. Gladstone moved his great and
long-expected measure.&nbsp; The desire to hear the statement of
the Premier was intense, Nationalist members sitting up all night
to secure their places.&nbsp; Never was there such a struggle on
the part of members to obtain seats.&nbsp; Chairs were set on the
floor of the House, by which means seventy or eighty additional
seats were <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>provided.&nbsp; The galleries, the nooks&mdash;in
short, every foot of standing ground was crowded with
chairs.&nbsp; Language fails to do justice to the intense
excitement of the hour, or to note the competition for every seat
in the Strangers&rsquo; Gallery; the scramble of the Lords, too,
for room in places assigned to them, the ovation rapturously
afforded by his followers to the hero of the hour, the physical
and mental efforts of the orator for more than two hours, the
rapt attention, diversified by bursts of cheers from one side and
ironical exclamations from the other, and the vociferous applause
at the close, are things never to be forgotten in the history of
our Parliamentary annals.&nbsp; The speech with which he wound up
the debate on the first reading in April was wonderfully
fine.&nbsp; &lsquo;He raised,&rsquo; writes Sir R. Temple,
&lsquo;the drooping spirits of his followers; he held his head
aloft; and in his wrath against the dissentient Liberals he
seemed to stand higher by inches than his ordinary
stature.&rsquo;&nbsp; His next effort, in unfolding his scheme
for buying out the Irish landlords, was not so successful.&nbsp;
After Mr. Chamberlain&rsquo;s attack on it, he is described as
having left the House apparently in high dudgeon.&nbsp; The
second reading of the Home Rule Bill was moved by Mr. Gladstone
amidst cheers from the Nationalist members alone.&nbsp; The
debate was animated and prolonged.&nbsp; On the closing night Mr.
Gladstone rose at midnight to deliver his fourth speech on the
Bill.&nbsp; &lsquo;For the last twenty minutes or so,&rsquo;
writes Sir R. Temple, &lsquo;I have never heard such oratory
anywhere from any man; indeed, he poured his very soul into
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; But all in vain.&nbsp; The Ayes were 311, the
Noes 341.&nbsp; Parliament was dissolved, and in the General
Election Home Rule was smitten, as far as England was concerned,
<a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>hip and
thigh.&nbsp; Lord Salisbury was Premier, Mr. Goschen joined the
Unionist party; and Mr. Chamberlain suggested the Round Table
Conference to fill up the Liberal ranks, to which Mr. Gladstone
heartily consented, but which came to nothing after all.</p>
<p>The chief event of this short session was a Tenant Relief
Bill, introduced by Mr. Parnell, providing for the suspension of
the ejectment of any defaulting tenant who should pay half his
rent and half his arrears.&nbsp; Let us add, this session was
memorable as the most trying one that had ever taken place, from
the acrimony of its debates and the late hours of its
sittings.&nbsp; However, Mr. Gladstone had got back Sir George
Trevelyan and three or four small men besides.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
the Government had to wince under the loss of several seats at
by-elections.&nbsp; At Southampton, the Unionist majority of 342
had been turned into a Gladstonian one of 885; and the Ayr Burghs
followed suit, by replacing a Unionist, whose majority had been
at the General Election 1,175, by a Gladstonian whom they
preferred to the extent of 53 votes to the Hon. Evelyn
Ashley.&nbsp; It was not till Christmas Eve that Parliament
adjourned.&nbsp; Government met Parliament the next year under
great discouragement.&nbsp; Before the debate on the
Queen&rsquo;s Speech was begun, Sir William Harcourt raised the
question of privilege, of which he maintained a breach had been
committed against the House by Tories in the matter of the
charges against the Irish members; and the diminished majority by
which his motion was rejected&mdash;58&mdash;testified to the
loss of prestige by the Government, as a consequence of their
supposed connection with a case bolstered up by the <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>forgeries
of the Irish informer Pigott.&nbsp; On the second reading of the
Local Taxation Bill, Mr. Caine moved an amendment refusing assent
to any proposal to extinguish licenses by means of public
money.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, in supporting it, defended himself
from the charge of having violated pledges given to his
Midlothian electors, declared that since those pledges had been
given &lsquo;the law had been cleared and settled in a manner not
only unfavourable to the doctrine of vested interests, but
likewise to the doctrine of permanent interest, on the part of a
publican in an annual license.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, Mr.
Gladstone spoke in vain.</p>
<p>Mr. Justin McCarthy, in his &lsquo;Life of Mr.
Gladstone,&rsquo; seems to show the gradual development of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s conversion to Home Rule.&nbsp; This was not at
all the sudden change that shallow satirists imagined.&nbsp; His
conviction was gradually borne in upon him by the close study of
Ireland imposed upon him as a preparation for his Church and Land
legislation.&nbsp; He hesitated long, because Ireland had never
sent a majority of Nationalists to Parliament.&nbsp; On this
subject Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s recollection of a conversation with
the great chief in the division lobby is very interesting:
&lsquo;He said to me in a somewhat emphatic tone that he could
not understand why a mere handful of Irish members, such as my
immediate colleagues were, should call themselves <i>par
excellence</i> the Irish Nationalist Party, while a much larger
number of Irish representatives, elected just as we were, kept
always assuring him that the Irish people had no manner of
sympathy with us or with our Home Rule scheme.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
am I to know?&rdquo; he asked me.&nbsp; &ldquo;These men far
outnumber you and your friends, and they are as <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>fairly
elected as you are.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said to him: &ldquo;Mr.
Gladstone, give us a popular franchise in Ireland, and we will
soon let you know whether we represent the Irish people or
whether we do not.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the election of 1885 they did
let him know, by returning 85 Nationalists out of 103 members for
Ireland.&nbsp; This settled the question in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>When a serious calamity occurred to the Irish party by reason
of the action brought against Mr. Parnell by Captain O&rsquo;Shea
for adultery with his wife, Mr. Gladstone was compelled to take
notice of the matter.&nbsp; The English Nonconformists and Scotch
Presbyterians made known to him their determination not to work
for Home Rule so long as Mr. Parnell remained at the head of the
Irish party.&nbsp; Accordingly, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Mr. John
Morley: &lsquo;I thought it necessary, reviewing arrangements for
the commencement of the present session, to acquaint Mr. McCarthy
with the conclusion at which I have arrived, after using all the
means of reflection and observation in my power.&nbsp; It was
this, that, notwithstanding the splendid services rendered by Mr.
Parnell to his country, his continuance at the present moment in
the leadership would be productive of consequences disastrous in
the highest degree to the cause of Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This led to serious charges of bad faith made against Mr.
Gladstone by Mr. Parnell.&nbsp; &lsquo;No single suggestion was
offered by me,&rsquo; wrote Mr. Gladstone in reply, &lsquo;as
formal, or as unanimous, or final.&nbsp; It was a statement,
perfectly free and without prejudice, of points in which either I
myself or such of my colleagues as I had been able to consult
inclined generally to believe that the plan for Home Rule in
Ireland might be <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>improved, and as to which I was desirous to learn
whether they raised any serious objection in the mind of Mr.
Parnell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In February, 1891, Mr. Gladstone moved the second reading of a
Bill which he had introduced to remove the disabilities which
prevented Roman Catholics from holding the appointment of Lord
Chancellor and Viceroy of Ireland.&nbsp; The Bill was rejected by
a majority of forty-seven.&nbsp; After this he almost entirely
disappears from the Parliament he had done so much to illustrate
and adorn.&nbsp; Never before has any statesman filled so large a
space in public life, or secured so enormous a popularity.&nbsp;
At times, even after 1892, there was talk of his returning to
Parliament as leader, to head his followers, who were as sheep
having no shepherd.&nbsp; But failing strength and advancing
years led him to retire from Parliament altogether, and fainter
grew his voice, and less frequent his utterances.&nbsp; Amongst
the latest was his message to his party in 1898, to stick to Lord
Rosebery and to attack the House of Lords.&nbsp; To the last the
Nonconformists of England and Scotland, in spite of his High
Church views, stuck to Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; Largely had he been
deserted by his old followers all over the country, who had
cheered Mr. Gladstone when he indignantly told the leaders of the
Irish party that their steps were dogged with crime; who had done
their best to give him a majority that would render him, as he
intimated, independent of the Irish vote, but who failed to
understand how, after such declarations, Mr. Gladstone could
spring on them a Home Rule Bill, which they were not prepared to
support.&nbsp; But none of these things affected the
Nonconformist Conscience.&nbsp; <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>In May, 1888, Mr. Gladstone received
an address at the Memorial Hall in Farringdon Street, in favour
of his Irish policy, signed by 3,370 Nonconformist
ministers.&nbsp; To the address, which was read by the Rev. J.
Guinness Rogers, Mr. Gladstone replied: &lsquo;I accept with
gratitude, as well as pleasure, the address which has been
presented to me, and I rejoice again to meet you within walls
which, although no great number of years have passed away since
their erection, have already become historic, and which are
associated in my mind, and in the minds of many, with honourable
struggles, sometimes under circumstances of depression, sometimes
under circumstances of promise, but always leading us forward,
whatever have been the phenomena of the moment, along the path of
truth and justice.&nbsp; I am very thankful to those who have
signed the address for the courageous manner in which they have
not scrupled to associate their political action and intention
with the principles and motives of their holy
religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not long after came the end of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
marvellous Parliamentary career.&nbsp; The originative power,
masterful vigour, and fiery energy which still characterized Mr.
Gladstone after passing his eightieth year were so extraordinary
that his followers almost regarded him as immortal.&nbsp; At any
rate, men of forty and fifty hardly expected to have to look for
another leader in their lifetime.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, the
time came for his retirement&mdash;came suddenly, and without
apparent cause.&nbsp; There were rumours, but there was nothing
certain, and his last Parliamentary words, in grave condemnation
of the changes made by the Lords in the Local Government Bill,
were spoken in March, <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>1894.&nbsp; The description of the
scene is one of the most effective passages in Mr.
McCarthy&rsquo;s book:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of us, of course, were in the secret, or at least
were vaguely forewarned of what we had to expect.&nbsp; Shortly
after Mr. Gladstone sat down I met Mr. John Morley in one of the
lobbies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that, then,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;the
very last speech?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The very last,&rdquo; was
his reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe one quarter of the
men in the House understand it so,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but it is so, all the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. McCarthy continues: &ldquo;No other man,
not Mr. Gladstone, would probably on such an occasion have made
it plain that he was giving his final farewell to the assembly
which he had charmed and over which he had dominated by his
eloquence for so many years.&nbsp; Lord Chatham certainly would
not have allowed himself to pass out of public life without
conveying to all men the idea that he spoke in Parliament for the
last time.&nbsp; But Mr. Gladstone, with all his magnificent
rhetorical gift, and with all his artistic instinct, had no
thought of getting up a scene. . . .&nbsp; In the theatric sense
I should describe his last speech as a dramatic failure.&nbsp;
Numbers of men lounged out of the House when the speech was over,
not having the least idea that they were never again to hear his
voice in Parliamentary debate.&nbsp; Yet I for one do not regret
that Mr. Gladstone thus took his leave of political life.&nbsp; I
am not sorry that there were no fireworks; that there was no
tableau; that there was no such dramatic fall of the
curtain.&nbsp; The orator during his closing speech was inspired
by one subject, and was not thinking of himself.&nbsp; A single
sentence interjected in the course of the speech would have told
every one of his hearers what was coming, and would have led to a
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>demonstration such as was probably never before known
in the House of Commons.&nbsp; It did not suit Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s tastes or inclinations to lead up to any such
demonstration, and therefore, while he warned the House of
Commons as to its duties and its responsibilities, he said not a
word about himself and about his action in the future.&nbsp;
Parliamentary history lost something, no doubt, by the manner of
his exhortation, but I think the character of the man will be
regarded as all the greater because at so supreme a moment he
forgot that the greatest Parliamentary career of the Victorian
era had come at last to its close.&rsquo;</p>
<p>About this time Mr. W. H. Smith, the &lsquo;Old
Mortality&rsquo; of <i>Punch</i>, writes: &lsquo;Gladstone is
more kindly in his personal relations than I have ever known him,
but he is physically much weaker, and the least exertion knocks
him up.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet Mr. Gladstone long outlived his amiable
critic.&nbsp; When in March Mr. W. H. Smith moved the adoption of
the report of the Parnell Commission, Mr. Gladstone moved an
amendment, and for two hours poured forth a stream of eloquence,
writes Sir R. Temple, like molten and liquid gold from the
furnace, with intonation and gesticulation quite marvellous for a
man of his advanced age; but his amendment was rejected.&nbsp; In
the debate on the Welsh Church he spoke for Disestablishment,
contending that when he argued for the Establishment the
political forces were for it, but now they were against it.&nbsp;
In the next year Mr. Gladstone made a speech in favour of peasant
proprietorship, and on the advantages of small tenures of land,
as on the Continent.&nbsp; He also opposed a grant for a railway
near <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Zanzibar.&nbsp; In a broad-minded and judicious manner
he supported the Government Bill for developing legislative
measures in India, and for giving the natives increased electoral
rights.&nbsp; He also supported the Clergy Discipline
(Immorality) Bill in terms, says Sir R. Temple, of noble
generosity towards the organization of the Church, yet in
language of courteous respect towards Nonconformists.</p>
<p>In the Parliament ruled over by Mr. Smith, Mr.
Gladstone&mdash;&lsquo;now seventy-six years,&rsquo; writes Mr.
Russell&mdash;entered on an extraordinary course of physical and
intellectual efforts with voice and pen, &lsquo;in Parliament and
on the platform,&rsquo; on behalf of his favourite scheme of
Irish Home Rule.&nbsp; In 1888 Mr. Neill O&rsquo;Daunt writes:
&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone has been justly and ably denouncing the
Union in the <i>Westminster Review</i> and other
periodicals.&nbsp; He has given many unanswerable arguments
against it.&nbsp; He might add, however, that if you want to
appreciate the evils of the Union, look at me, W. E. G.&nbsp;
When Ireland lay crushed and prostrate beneath the miseries of a
seven years&rsquo; famine, when multitudes had perished by
starvation, and when all who could obtain the passage-money fled
to America, I, W. E. G., secured that propitious moment to give a
spur to the exodus by adding 52 per cent. to the taxation of
Ireland, and pleaded the terms of the Union as my justification
for inflicting this scourge on the suffering people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is characteristic of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s loyalty that
when engaged in celebrating his golden wedding, he found time to
attend the House of Commons and deliver a speech in support of
the Royal Grants.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone had left Parliament, had passed away <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>from public
life.&nbsp; Fight was in him, nevertheless, to the last.&nbsp;
When in the winter of 1898 he started for the South of France,
according to newspaper reports, he advised his followers to
continue the attack on the House of Lords; and when the Irish
celebrated St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in March in London, he wrote
to them, advising union if they would gain the day.&nbsp; I
prefer, however, and I think many will agree with me, to think of
the aged and illustrious man as he was leaving Bournemouth for
Hawarden in March of the same year, putting his head out of the
window, and saying to the crowd who had come to see him off:
&lsquo;God bless you all, and the land you love!&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. GLADSTONE&rsquo;S
SPEECHES.</span></h2>
<p>In 1892 appeared part of what was to be a ten-volume edition
of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s speeches, edited by Mr. William Hutton,
librarian, National Liberal Club, and R. J. Cowen, of the Inner
Temple, barrister-at-law.&nbsp; The work is a labour of love on
the part of the two editors, and Mr. Gladstone himself
contributes a modest preface.&nbsp; He has seen such passages as
seemed to require revision, and he testifies to their
correctness.&nbsp; In some instances the editors have made verbal
amendments where it was apparent that the text was
misreported.&nbsp; They have also added brief notes, just
sufficient to recall the circumstances under which the speeches
were delivered.&nbsp; It is in his perorations that Mr. Gladstone
rises to his loftiest rhetoric, as is seen in the one delivered
in his great Birmingham speech of 1885 on Ireland&rsquo;s new
weapons: &lsquo;Ah, gentlemen, may I tell you with what weapons
Ireland is fighting this battle?&nbsp; She is not fighting it
with the weapons of menace, with a threat of separation, with
Fenian outbreaks, with the extension of secret societies.&nbsp;
Happily those ideas have passed away into a distance
undefined.&nbsp; She is fighting the contest with the <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>weapons of
confidence and affection&mdash;of confidence in the powerful
party by whose irrevocable decision she is supported, and of
affection towards the people of England.&nbsp; May I tell you one
incident, that will not occupy two minutes, in proof of what I
say?&nbsp; In the county, I think, of Limerick, not very many
days ago, an Englishman was addressing a crowd of Irish
Nationalists on the subject of Home Rule.&nbsp; His carriage or
his train, whichever it was, was just going to depart.&nbsp;
Someone cried out, &ldquo;God save Ireland!&rdquo; and there was
a loud burst of cheering.&nbsp; The train started, the cheering
subsided.&nbsp; Another voice from the crowd was raised, and
shouted, &ldquo;And God save England!&rdquo; and there were
cheers louder still, such in the language of Shakespeare that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Make the welkin ring again,<br />
And fetch still echoes from the hollow earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These cheers were the genuine expression of the sentiment of
the country.&nbsp; They, our opponents, teach you to rely on the
use of this deserted and enfeebled and superannuated weapon of
coercion.&nbsp; We teach you to rely upon Irish affection and
goodwill.&nbsp; We teach you not to speculate on the formation of
that sentiment.&nbsp; We show you that it is formed already; it
is in full force; it is ready to burst forth from every Irish
heart and through every Irish voice.&nbsp; We only beseech you,
by resolute adherence to that policy you have adopted, to foster,
to cherish, to consolidate that sentiment, and so to act that in
space it shall spread from the north of Ireland to the south, and
from the west of Ireland to the east; and in time it shall extend
and endure from the present date until the last of the years and
the last of the centuries that may still be reserved in the <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>counsels of
Providence to work out the destinies of mankind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps more of our readers will agree with Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s eulogy of books in opening a working
men&rsquo;s library in Saltney:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now I commend you again to your books.&nbsp; Books
are delightful society.&nbsp; If you go into a room and find it
full of books&mdash;and without even taking them down from their
shelves&mdash;they seem to speak to you, to bid you
welcome.&nbsp; They seem to tell you that they have got something
inside their covers that will be good for you, and that they are
willing and desirous to impart to you.&nbsp; Value them
much.&nbsp; Endeavour to turn them to good account, and pray
recollect this, that the education of the mind is not merely a
stowage of goods in the mind.&nbsp; The mind of man, some people
seem to think, is a storehouse that should be filled with a
quantity of useful commodities which may be taken out like
packets from a shop, and delivered and distributed according to
the occasions of life.&nbsp; I will not say that this is not true
as far as it goes; but it goes a very little way, for commodities
may be taken in and commodities may be given out, but the
warehouse remains just the same as it was before, or probably a
little worse.&nbsp; That ought not to be the case with a
man&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; No doubt you are to cull knowledge that
is useful for the temporal purpose of life, but never forget that
the purpose for which a man lives is the improvement of the man
himself, so that he may go out of this world having, in his great
sphere or his small one, done some little good to his
fellow-creatures, and laboured a little to diminish the sin and
the sorrow that are in the world.&nbsp; For his own growth <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>and
development a man should seek to acquire, to his full capacity,
useful knowledge, in order to deal it out again according to the
supreme purposes of education.&nbsp; I remember just now I said
that, outside of science, the chance for a labouring man to
acquire knowledge was comparatively very little, unless he
acquire it through observation.&nbsp; The poet Gray describes the
condition of the rustics of the village in these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But Knowledge to their eyes her
ample page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich with the spoils of Time, did ne&rsquo;er
unroll;<br />
Chill Penury repressed their noble rage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And froze the genial current of the soul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have witnessed an improvement upon that state of
things.&nbsp; Knowledge has now begun to unroll her ample page,
and chill Penury does not now so universally repress.&nbsp; Let
that improvement itself be improved upon, not necessarily by
grand, imposing designs, but by each of us according to his
means, with the sedulous endeavour to do our duty to our
neighbour and our service to our country.&nbsp; Let me express
the fervent hope that this literary institute may thrive, and may
largely and continuously contribute to the prosperity of Saltney
and the happiness of its people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the Dundee address on &lsquo;Art and Industry,&rsquo;
delivered on October 29, 1890, Mr. Gladstone half playfully, half
seriously, denounced the vagaries of fashion:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, shall I shock you if I tell you what perhaps is
partly only a personal opinion of my own?&nbsp; The study of
beauty has several very formidable enemies.&nbsp; One of them, of
course, is haste in production, carelessness in production.&nbsp;
Sometimes the desire for cheapness makes people think you cannot
have cheapness and <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>beauty together.&nbsp; But the particular enemy which I
think is one of the most formidable of all to the true
comprehension and true pursuit of beauty is that thing which is
known under the name of fashion.&nbsp; That may seem strange to
the young gentlemen who want to be smart in their dress.&nbsp; I
will not speak of young ladies.&nbsp; To them I have no doubt it
will sound as if I was using language certainly rash, and perhaps
almost profane.&nbsp; What is fashion?&nbsp; Gentlemen and
ladies, if the ladies have anything to do with it&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t say whether it is so or not&mdash;what is
fashion?&nbsp; Fashion of dress is perpetual change.&nbsp;
Wherever there is perpetual change, if it is to be justifiable or
if it is to be useful, there ought to be perpetual
progress.&nbsp; But fashion is not perpetual progress; fashion is
a zigzag.&nbsp; Fashion is a wheel which whirls round and round,
and by-and-by, after a fashion has been left, after it has been
discarded, if you have only a little patience to wait long
enough, you will find you will go back to it.&nbsp; Ladies and
gentlemen, you are young and I am old; I have seen this wheel of
fashion going round and round, always puzzling you, like a
firework wheel, but always landing in a total negation of
progress, and with a strong tendency to the substitution of mere
caprice and mere display for the true pursuit of
beauty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1894 appeared another volume.&nbsp; Nominally it was the
ninth volume, but the order of sequence is apparently to be from
last to first.&nbsp; The new volume is one of the most important
of the series, since it contains the great speech on introducing
the first Home Rule Bill, and seventeen speeches of later date,
mainly upon Home Rule.&nbsp; Some of these speeches present the
great Parliamentary orator at his very highest&mdash;<a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>broad in
sweep, dexterous in sword-play, flashing with wit, pellucid in
expression, driving home his case with passionate appeal and a
rush of ingenious argument.&nbsp; Whether we agree with him or
not, it is impossible, even in cold print, not to admire the
overpowering ability of the &lsquo;old Parliamentary
hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here is the peroration of the first great
speech on introducing the first Home Rule Bill:</p>
<p>&lsquo;However this may be, we are sensible that we have taken
an important decision&mdash;our choice has been made.&nbsp; It
has not been made without thought; it has been made in the full
knowledge that trial and difficulty may confront us on our
path.&nbsp; We have no right to say that Ireland through her
constitutionally-chosen representatives will accept the plan I
offer.&nbsp; Whether it will be so I do not know&mdash;I have no
title to assume it&mdash;but if Ireland does not cheerfully
accept it, it is impossible for us to attempt to force upon her
what is intended to be a boon; nor can we possibly press England
and Scotland to accord to Ireland what she does not heartily
welcome and embrace.&nbsp; There are difficulties, but I rely
upon the patriotism and sagacity of this House; I rely on the
effects of free and full discussion; and I rely more than all
upon the just and generous sentiments of the two British
nations.&nbsp; Looking forward, I ask the House to assist us in
the work which we have undertaken, and to believe that no trivial
motive can have driven us to it&mdash;to assist us in this work
which we believe will restore Parliament to its dignity, and
legislation to its free and unimpeded course.&nbsp; I ask you to
stay that waste of public treasure which is involved in the
present system of government and legislation in Ireland; and
which is not a waste only, <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>but which demoralizes while it
exhausts.&nbsp; I ask you to show to Europe and to America that
we, too, can face political problems which America twenty years
ago faced, and which many countries in Europe have been called
upon to face, and have not feared to deal with.&nbsp; I ask that
in our own case we should practise with firm and fearless hand
what we have so often preached&mdash;the doctrine which we have
so often inculcated upon others&mdash;namely, that the concession
of local self-government is not the way to sap or impair, but the
way to strengthen and consolidate, unity.&nbsp; I ask that we
should learn to rely less upon merely written stipulations, and
more upon those better stipulations which are written on the
heart and mind of man.&nbsp; I ask that we should apply to
Ireland that happy experience which we have gained in England and
in Scotland, where the course of generations has now taught us,
not as a dream or a theory, but as practice and as life, that the
best and surest foundation we can find to build upon is the
foundation afforded by the affections, the convictions, and the
will of the nation; and it is thus, by the decree of the
Almighty, that we may be enabled to secure at once the social
peace, the fame, the power, and the permanence of the
empire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In another style, but very characteristic, I quote from the
speech delivered by Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden in the Jubilee
year, reviewing the reign of the Queen:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I have said quite enough for this occasion, and I
think enough to justify me in reminding you that although a
jubilee may be regarded as an affair of form and ceremony, there
is a great deal more than form and ceremony in this
Jubilee.&nbsp; It invites us and <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>compels us to cast our thoughts
backward over that long series of years with which we are almost
all of us familiar, and it imposes upon us the duty of deep
thankfulness to the Almighty, who in these late days, when our
history is so long, and when some might have thought that our
nation and our constitution had grown old, has given us as a
people a renovated youth; who has inspired us with renewed
activity and with buoyant hope; who has conducted us thus far
upon the road to improvement and advancement in the pursuit, not
of false, but of true human happiness; who has made the laws of
this country no longer odious, no longer suspected, but dear to
the people at large, and who has thereby encouraged us&mdash;I
will not say much of encouragement to men of my age, whose life
is in the past more than in the future&mdash;it has encouraged
all those who are grown up or coming on, who are in the first
glow of youth or in the prime and vigour of manhood, to persevere
and endeavour to make the coming years, if they can, not worse,
but better than those which have gone by.&nbsp; I beseech you, if
you owe the debt of gratitude to the Queen for that which I have
described, for her hearty concurrence in the work of public
progress and improvement, for the admirable public example which
her life has uniformly set, for her thorough comprehension of the
true conditions of the great covenant between the throne and the
people&mdash;if you owe her a debt of gratitude for these, may I
say to you: Try to acknowledge that debt by remembering her in
your prayers.&nbsp; Depend upon it that when St. Paul enjoined
that prayers should be made for all men, and gave the commanding
and the leading place to prayers for kings and all in authority,
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>St. Paul
spoke the language not only of religion, but of the most profound
social justice and human common-sense.&nbsp; Do not imagine that
because in this world some live in greater splendour and greater
enjoyment than others, they therefore live free of temptation, so
as not to need the prayers of their fellow-Christians.&nbsp;
Depend upon it, the higher placed one is in society, the greater
are his difficulties, and the more subtle the temptations that
surround his path, and that which is true as we rise from rank to
rank is not least of all, but most of all, true when we come to
the elevated and august position of the Sovereign, who, as a
sovereign, more than any one among her subjects, needs the
support which the prayers and the intercessions of her subjects
offered for her to her Saviour can afford.&nbsp; Forgive me for
entreating you not to forget that duty; not to forget that simple
mode at the command of all, in which everyone who thinks the
Queen has nobly done her duty to them may perform a great and
beneficial duty to her and for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We give one other extract from a speech at Swansea in
1887&mdash;&lsquo;The Union of Hearts&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No difference connected with this question ought for a
moment to impede our steady march upon the path on which we are
entered&mdash;the path which leads us to a happy consummation of
a just and politic arrangement between the two nations.&nbsp; I
have reminded you of the objects which the arrangement
contemplated&mdash;objects the dearest of which can endear them
to the hearts of men, the greatness of the empire, the solidity
of the empire, the true cohesion of the empire, the happiness of
the people, the union of classes, the establishment of social
order, the rule of <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>law by moral as well as by physical force in one of the
great divisions of the country, and finally the restoration of
the honour and character of the country, so grievously
compromised by this painful subject.&nbsp; These are the objects
which make our present arduous labours worth persevering in and
make us determined to pursue them.&nbsp; There was on one of the
banners we saw to-day a phrase that I referred to in addressing
our friends outside, and which made a deep impression upon
me&mdash;&ldquo;The union of hearts, not manacles.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What is our union with Ireland now?&nbsp; It is the union of
manacles, and not of hearts.&nbsp; It is a force that attaches
Ireland to us.&nbsp; What said Mr. Bright?&nbsp; If Ireland were
towed out 2,000 miles into the Atlantic your relations with
Ireland would be at an end.&nbsp; We want to substitute for that
union of force the union of hearts.&nbsp; We want that Ireland
shall be united to England as Wales is united to England, as
Scotland is united to England, not that they should be dead to
their own national interests and concerns, but that they should
desire to pursue them and promote them as measures of a firmly
united and compacted empire.&nbsp; We have a state of things in
Ireland by which, if we seize and do not lose the golden
opportunity, this same union may be gained.&nbsp; While Ireland,
in consonance with her traditions and in consequence of those
physical circumstances by which she is divided from us by the
Channel, desires the management of her own concerns, she is
happily disposed to union with us, and to be at one with us in
everything that concerns the greatness of the empire; but if this
golden opportunity be lost we know not when it will return.&nbsp;
The rule is that lost opportunities do not return, or, if they
return, they return only after <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>long intervals and after heavy
damages have been paid for the original neglect.&nbsp; God grant
that these mischiefs may be avoided&mdash;at any rate, with
regard to the subject that is now before us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A remarkable illustration of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
many-sidedness is to be found in the fact that on one occasion he
went to dine with the poor at St. Pancras Workhouse in 1879, with
600 of the aged inmates, at a dinner given by Mr. E. Skerries,
one of the guardians.&nbsp; In the course of his speech Mr.
Gladstone said: &lsquo;My life presents to me a great variety of
scenes and occasions; but among all these scenes and occasions I
tell you, with unfeigned sincerity, I have not witnessed one for
a long time that has filled me with heartier or tenderer pleasure
than to be a guest at the present assembly.&nbsp; I likewise
desired, I am well aware, in a slight manner to take an
opportunity which does not often occur to me of testifying, as
far as I can, my interest in your lot.&nbsp; In this great
establishment of which you are inmates it is not possible,
consistently with the interests of the community, to give many
indulgences by rule and under system, which I am convinced many
of those who govern you would desire to give if they felt it
could be done with safety.&nbsp; It is not because the giving or
receiving of such indulgences would be mischievous or dangerous
to yourselves; it is the effect, which I am quite sure you can
well appreciate, which would be produced upon the community at
large, if these establishments, which are maintained out of the
labour of the community and at its charge, were made
establishments of luxurious living.&nbsp; It is necessary that
the independent labourer of the country should not be solicited
and tempted to <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>forego his duty to his wife and children and the
community by thinking that he could do better for himself by
making himself a charge on that community.&nbsp; There is no more
subtle poison that could be infused into the community than a
system of that kind.&nbsp; We were in danger of it some fifty or
sixty years ago, but the spirit and courage of the Parliament of
1834 and the Government of that day introduced a sounder system,
and matters are here regulated with what I believe and trust
is&mdash;and I believe you would be able to echo what I
say&mdash;with firmness and kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the charges against Mr. Parnell and his friends were made
in the House of Commons, Mr. Gladstone was strongly against their
vindication of themselves in a court of law&mdash;on the first
ground, on the plea of the law&rsquo;s delay, and, secondly, from
the character of our judges.&nbsp; He blamed Lord Randolph
Churchill for speaking in their favour.&nbsp; He entirely
differed from that noble lord as to the judges.&nbsp; He believed
all judges now on the bench could be trusted perfectly.&nbsp; But
there was one judge now upon the bench who came down from the
bench to take a part in regard to the great Irish Question more
violent than had been taken by any layman he could
remember.&nbsp; If one of the gentlemen sitting below the gangway
said it was excusable in him to feel some mistrust in such a
case, though he (Mr. Gladstone) should not feel mistrust himself,
he could understand that mistrust.&nbsp; Was it so certain a
verdict would be got?&nbsp; As to the certainty of getting
verdicts against newspapers in cases where a public man attempted
to restrain the liberty of newspaper comment on his own conduct,
he might mention that thirty years ago he <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>had the
honour to serve Her Majesty as High Commissioner of the Ionian
Islands.&nbsp; The people of the Ionian Islands had little or
nothing to complain of as to practical grievances, but they were
possessed with an intense sentiment of nationality.&nbsp; That
sentiment determined them to be content with nothing except union
with their own blood and race, and that sentiment was treated by
a portion of the press of this country, and especially by a
portion of the Metropolitan press, with unmeasured and bitter
contempt.&nbsp; It was said: &lsquo;Who are these miserable
Ionians that desire to join themselves to an equally miserable
set of people in Greece, instead of welcoming the glory of being
attached to a great empire?&rsquo;&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> said,
in effect: &lsquo;The Ionian Assembly has been committing
treason, and the Queen&rsquo;s Commissioner has been aiding them
to commit that treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; He determined to prosecute
the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; He took the best advice from legal
friends of weight and character, and every one of those gentlemen
said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t dream of it.&nbsp; You cannot get a
verdict.&rsquo;&nbsp; He would have gone into court without one
particular prejudice against him, but in this case there was in
the minds of a portion of the public a gross and cruel
prejudice.&nbsp; His legal advisers protested so positively
against any such trial that he had to acquiesce in that gross and
monstrous charge.&nbsp; Juries had a just and proper prejudice in
favour of the liberty of the press, and if he himself were a
juror it would take very much indeed to make him give a verdict
in restraint of the liberty of the press.&nbsp; He could not
think they were entitled to condemn in the slightest degree the
hon. member for East Mayo, if he declined to commit <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>himself to
the mercy or the chance of a court of law.</p>
<p>As another proof of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s versatility, let us
notice a speech delivered at the Hawarden Flower Show on fruit
and vegetable culture, in which he dwelt on the importance of
garden cultivation.&nbsp; He commenced by remarking that that was
a time when leading people had to consider more seriously than
they were accustomed to do in times of prosperity how they could
better their position, and struggle with the vicissitudes of time
and climate more effectually than on former occasions they had
been able to do.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said Mr.
Gladstone, &lsquo;that one of the modes in which the cultivators
of the soil in this country&mdash;I will draw no distinction at
present between small and large&mdash;may improve their position
is by paying a greater attention to what is called garden and
spade cultivation.&nbsp; Perhaps it will surprise you if I tell
you what is the value of the fruit and vegetables imported into
this country from abroad.&nbsp; Now, of dried fruits there are
imported into this country a value of about
&pound;2,346,000.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t speak so much of those,
because a large proportion consists of products, such as
currants, figs, and raisins, that are not adapted to the latitude
of this country; but I find that a vast quantity is imported of
raw fruit, such as apples, pears, stone-fruit, and the
like.&nbsp; No less than &pound;1,704,000 worth of raw fruit is
generally imported into this country.&nbsp; Then, when I come to
vegetables, a still larger proportion is imported.&nbsp; There
are &pound;414,000 worth of onions imported, but, I take it,
there is no better country for the growth of onions than this
country.&nbsp; There were, taking potatoes and other kinds of
vegetables, about <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&pound;5,000,000 imported.&nbsp; I should like to see
this fruit and these vegetables grown at home.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone then went on to show how lucrative was the growing of
vegetables.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was a natural taste on the part of
the people to cottage garden cultivation, and a vast deal of
profitable industry might be set in motion by the extension of
this cottage gardening, and by the introduction of the spade
cultivation where it was found suitable, even upon larger masses
of land than were at the command of cottagers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At a breakfast in 1887, given by Dr. Parker, at which a large
number of Nonconformist ministers were present, in the course of
his speech Mr. Gladstone said: &lsquo;I have no difficulty
whatever in referring to the language which I myself and others
have used in respect to the Irish party about six years ago, and
in bringing that language into comparison with what I have said
of them within the last few weeks.&nbsp; Six years ago it was our
conviction that the leaders of the Irish party were engaged in
operations which, although they might have considered them to be
justified and called for by the circumstances of the country, we
thought were of a blamable and dangerous, and even ruinous
character.&nbsp; I did say at that time that the footsteps of
what was called the Land League were, in my opinion, dogged with
crime&mdash;that where the Land League went, crime followed
it.&nbsp; I did say at that time, when, as we believed, there was
a general movement against the payment of rates and fulfilling of
contracts as a whole&mdash;I did say at that time that it was a
question of proceeding through rapine to dismemberment.&nbsp;
Those were very grave words to use.&nbsp; They may have been
warranted, or they may have been unwarranted; they may <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>have been
exaggerated, or they may have been justified by the circumstances
of the case, but I believed them, and they were spoken with
sincerity.&nbsp; I am bound to say this, that I am not prepared
to say at this moment that they were without force and
truth.&nbsp; Grave charges were made at that time by the
Nationalist party against us.&nbsp; Some of those charges I can
now see to have been true, and I see that that is the case not
for the first time.&nbsp; I see that some of the measures which
we proposed, especially the measure for the suspension of the
Habeas Corpus Act, were unhappy and mischievous measures; but we
spoke according to the circumstances that were before us.&nbsp;
It is quite true that we were aware then, as now, that enormous
allowances were to be made for men acting in Ireland under the
difficulties of their position, and with the smarting and painful
recollection of their past history; but we spoke the truth then,
and we speak the truth now.&nbsp; The other day, following the
steps of Lord Spencer, I stated in public that there was not, so
far as I knew, and that there never had been, any reason for
charging upon Mr. Parnell and the members of the Irish party
complicity with crime.&nbsp; That is perfectly true; and it is
what I would have said six years ago.&nbsp; I believed then that
their language was dangerous, and that their plans were
questionable, that they had a tendency to the production of
crime; but that is a thing totally different from complicity with
crime.&rsquo;</p>

170</span>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. GLADSTONE&rsquo;S
PUBLICATIONS.</span></h2>
<p>When George III. was King, two of his servants, as retired
Ministers, met one another at Bath.&nbsp; Said one of them, Lord
Mendip, to the other, Lord Camden, &lsquo;I hope you are well and
in the enjoyment of a happy old age.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord Camden
replied in a querulous tone: &lsquo;Happy!&nbsp; How can a man be
happy who has survived all his passions and
enjoyments?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, my dear lord,&rsquo; was the
reply of his old antagonist, &lsquo;do not talk so; while God is
pleased to enable me to read my Homer and my Bible, I cannot but
be thankful and happy.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is easy to imagine Mr.
Gladstone making a similar reply.&nbsp; His love of Homer is only
equalled by his love of the Bible.&nbsp; Porson used to say of
Bishop Pearson that, if he had not muddled his head with
theology, he would have been a first-class critic in Greek.&nbsp;
Mr. Gladstone, as we have seen, has had a good deal to do with
theology, but that he has not muddled his brains with it is
clear, not merely from his active life as a statesman, but from
the perusal of the many valuable works he has written on Homer,
and his life and time and work.&nbsp; The subject seems to have
endless attractions for him.&nbsp; Charles James Fox used to read
Homer <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>through every year.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone displays a
still greater enthusiasm.&nbsp; In this department of human
inquiry he has been emphatically distinguished, and his works on
Homer, to do them adequate justice, would require a volume by no
means small to themselves.&nbsp; In 1838 his first great work on
the subject appeared.&nbsp; It was entitled &lsquo;Studies of
Homer and the Homeric Age,&rsquo; and consisted of three large
volumes.&nbsp; In 1869 he republished and rewrote a great part of
the previous volumes in his &lsquo;Juventus Mundi: the Gods and
Men of the Heroic Age.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am anxious,&rsquo;
he writes, &lsquo;to commend to inquirers and readers generally
conclusions from the Homeric poems which appear to me to be of
great interest with reference to the general history of human
culture, and in connection therewith with the Providential
government of the world.&nbsp; But I am much more anxious to
encourage and facilitate the access of educated persons to the
actual contents of the text.&nbsp; The amount and variety of
these contents have not been fully apparent.&nbsp; The delight
received from the poems has possibly had some influence in
disposing the generality of readers to rest satisfied with their
enjoyment.&nbsp; The doubts cast upon their origin must have
assisted in producing and fostering a vague instinctive
indisposition to further laborious examination.&nbsp; The very
splendour of the poems dazzles the eyes with whole sheets of
lightning, and may almost give to analysis the character of
vulgarity or impertinence.&rsquo;&nbsp; In his preface Mr.
Gladstone tells us that his ideas have been considerably modified
in the ethnological and mythological portions of his
inquiry.&nbsp; The chief source of modification in the former has
been that a further prosecution of the subject with <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>respect to
the Ph&oelig;nicians has brought out more clearly and fully what
he had only ventured to suspect&mdash;a highly influential
function in forming the Greek element.&nbsp; A fuller view of
this element in its composition naturally aids in an important
manner upon any estimate of Pelasgians and Hellenes
respectively.&nbsp; This Ph&oelig;nician influence reaches far
into the sphere of mythology, and tends, as he thinks, greatly to
clear the views we may reasonably take of that curious and
interesting subject.&nbsp; The aim of this revised edition of his
Homeric studies was to assist Homeric studies in our schools and
Universities, and to convey a practical knowledge of the subject
to persons who are not habitual students.</p>
<p>Few men have found time to appear in print so frequently as
Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; His latest publication bears the date of
1898; his earliest appeared in 1837.&nbsp; One of his great
topics has been Homer.&nbsp; The old Greek poet ought to be,
according to Mr. Gladstone, in everyone&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; His
latest work on the subject was the &lsquo;Landmarks of Homeric
Study, together with an Essay on the Points of Contact between
the Assyrian Tablets and the Homeric Text,&rsquo; which appeared
in 1890.&nbsp; Among the numberless solutions of the Homeric
question since the days of Wolff, he still maintains the
traditional view that there was but one Homer, that he wrote both
poems, and that the poems themselves should be regarded as a
historic whole.&nbsp; In Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s view one of
Homer&rsquo;s chief functions was to weld the diverse elements of
the Hellenic nation into one.&nbsp; National unity necessarily
involved religious unity, and so Mr. Gladstone goes on to
propound the theory that Homer endeavoured to find a <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>place in
his heaven for all the gods that had been worshipped by the
different races he was welding together, and that with this view
he created a composite system of religion.&nbsp; It affords us
matter for wonder, he says, as well as admiration, how Homer
excluded from this new composite system the most degrading
ingredients in which the religions around him abounded.&nbsp;
Though forced to admit Aphrodite, he only admitted her to a lower
place, and presented her in an unfavourable light.&nbsp; She is,
in fact, only the Assyrian Ishtar, the Ashtoreth of the Hebrews
and Ph&oelig;nicians.&nbsp; He also elaborately contends that
there was a good deal of morality among Homer&rsquo;s Greeks, far
more than is generally supposed.&nbsp; The Politics of Homer form
another chapter, and he finds high praise for the value the poet
attached to personal freedom, and in the extraordinary power for
those times he attached to the spoken word.&nbsp; Except in the
concluding chapter on Assyrian Tablets and the Homeric Texts, Mr.
Gladstone added little to what is to be found in one or other of
his previous books.</p>
<p>In 1896 appeared &lsquo;The Impregnable Rock of Holy
Scripture,&rsquo; revised and enlarged from <i>Good
Words</i>.&nbsp; The argument appears to be that in the science
and history of the Holy Bible there may be detected a degree of
accuracy plainly supernatural and miraculous.&nbsp; With great
warmth he owns his desire to prevent his countrymen from relaxing
their hold on the Bible, which Christendom regards as &lsquo;an
inestimable treasure,&rsquo; and thus bringing on themselves
&lsquo;inexpressible calamity.&rsquo;&nbsp; He adopts towards
Hebrew specialists an attitude neither defiant nor abjectly
submissive.&nbsp; The meaning of Hebrew words must, of course, be
determined by <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>Hebrew scholars; but he argues that we must not forget
the risks to which specialists themselves are exposed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Among them,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;as with other men,
there may be fashions of the time and school, which Lord Bacon
called idols of the market-place, and currents of prejudice below
the surface, such as to detract somewhat from the authority which
each inquirer may justly claim in his own field, and from their
title to impose these conclusions upon mankind.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
so often has it already happened that the Bible was supposed to
be submerged by some wave of opinion, which proved, after all, to
be passing and ephemeral, that we may have confidence in its
power of weathering storms.&nbsp; He holds that if, even for
argument&rsquo;s sake, one concession were to be made to
specialists of all they can be entitled to ask respecting the
age, the authorship, the text of the books, he may still invite
his readers to stand with him on the impregnable rock of Holy
Scripture.&nbsp; Apart from all that science or criticism may
say, he can still challenge men to accept the Scriptures on the
moral and spiritual and historical ground of their character in
themselves.&nbsp; In the course of his work he treats
successively of the creation story as told in the first chapter
of Genesis, of the Psalms, of the Mosaic legislation, of the
Deluge, and of recent corroborations of Scripture from history
and natural science.</p>
<p>In 1848 Mr. Gladstone wrote a Latin version of Toplady&rsquo;s
hymn, &lsquo;Rock of Ages,&rsquo; though it did not appear till
1861, when it was published in a volume of translations by
himself and Lord Lyttelton, issued by them in memory of their
marriage to two sisters.&nbsp; The following is the
translation:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&lsquo;Jesu, pro me perforatus,<br />
Condar intra Tuum latus.<br />
Tu per lympham profluentem,<br />
Tu per sanguinem tepentem,<br />
In peccata mi redunda,<br />
Tolle culpam, sordes munda.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coram Te, nec justus forem,<br />
Quamvis tot&acirc; vi laborem,<br />
Nec si fide nunquam cesso,<br />
Fletu stillans indefesso,<br />
Tibi soli tantum munus;<br />
Salva me, Salvator unus!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nil in manu mecum fero,<br />
Sed me versus crucem gero;<br />

Nisi laves, moribundus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dum hos artus vita regit;<br />
Quando nox sepulchro tegit;<br />
Mortuos cum stare jubes,<br />
Sedens Judex inter nubes;<br />
Jesu, pro me perforatus,<br />
Condar intra Tuum latus.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1863 Mr. Gladstone printed his translation of the first
book of the &lsquo;Iliad.&rsquo;&nbsp; He sent a copy to Lord
Lyndhurst, then in his ninety-first year.&nbsp; The aged critic
replied in the following letter.&nbsp; The accident to which it
alludes was one which had happened some days before to Mr.
Gladstone when riding in the Park:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear
Gladstone</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are very sorry for your accident, but rejoice that
the consequence is not likely to be serious.&nbsp; What should we
do with the surplus without you?&nbsp; I return with thanks the
translation.&nbsp; It is a remarkable effort of ingenuity,
literal almost to a fault, and in a poetical form.&nbsp; But is
the trochee suited to our heroic verse?&nbsp; Its real character
is in some degree disguised by your mode of printing the
lines.&nbsp; If the usual mode were adopted, the defect would at
once appear:</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&lsquo;&ldquo;Of Achilles, son of Peleus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How the deadly wrath arose!<br />
How the hosts of the Achaians<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rued it with ten thousand woes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Written and read in this way, it has a sort of ballad
air.&nbsp; If I am wrong, correct me.&nbsp; Perhaps I have been
too long accustomed to the iambic measure with variations, as
best suited to English heroic poetry, to be able to form a
correct opinion.&nbsp; As an example of trochaic lines, there are
several in Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s
Feast&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Bacchus, ever fair and young,<br />
Drunken joys did first ordain,&rdquo; etc.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gladstone thought so highly of this criticism that he
wrote back asking permission to print it in a contemplated
preface to his translation.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;from a mere wish to parade you as my correspondent,
though this wish may have its share.&nbsp; Your observation on my
metre, which has great force, cuts, I think, deep into the
matter&mdash;into the principles of Homeric translation.&nbsp; So
pray let me have your permission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As an illustration of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s skill as a
translator, let me add some verses from his version of the
&lsquo;Hecuba&rsquo; of Euripides, seven pages of which appeared
in the <i>Contemporary Review</i> a few years since, though the
translation was made in his Eton days:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Antistrophe I</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas dead of night, and silence deep<br />
Buried all in dewy sleep,<br />
For feast, and dance, and slaughter done,<br />
Soft slumber&rsquo;s season had begun.<br />
The lyre was hushed, the altar cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword, the lance, all bloodless lay;<br />
My husband, softly resting, told<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The toils and dangers of the day:<br />
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>No
longer watching for the foe<br />
Sworn to lay proud Ilion low.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Strophe
II</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I strove my flowing hair to bind<br />
With many a festal chaplet twin&rsquo;d;<br />
The mirror&rsquo;s rays of glittering hue<br />
Betrayed me to my virgin view,<br />
Hast&rsquo;ning to rest&mdash;Then peal&rsquo;d on high<br />
O&rsquo;er Ilion&rsquo;s walls the victor&rsquo;s cry;<br />
Troy heard the shout that sounded then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dash&rsquo;d down the turrets of the foe,<br
/>
Shall sons of Greece again, again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To home, and rest, and glory go.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1892 appeared &lsquo;An Academic Sketch&rsquo; by the Right
Hon. W. E. Gladstone, M.P., being the Romanes Lecture delivered
in the Sheldon Theatre, Oxford.&nbsp; Whilst it did not detract
from, it scarcely added to, Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
reputation.&nbsp; It was, in fact, a speech somewhat of the
after-dinner type.&nbsp; All the world knew that the Oxford of
the past was a theme on which he could pleasantly dilate.</p>
<p>In 1894 there appeared from Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s pen an
article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> on the
&lsquo;Atonement,&rsquo; occasioned by the study of Mrs.
Besant&rsquo;s &lsquo;Autobiography.&rsquo;&nbsp; He says of her:
&lsquo;Mrs. Besant passes from her earliest to her latest stage
of thought as lightly as a swallow skims the surface of the lawn,
and with just as little effort to ascertain what lies beneath
it.&nbsp; Her several schemes of belief or non-belief appear to
have been entertained one after another with the same undoubting
confidence, until the junctures successively arrived for their
not regretful, but rather contemptuous, rejection.&nbsp; They are
nowhere based upon reasoning, but on the authority of Mrs.
Besant.&rsquo;&nbsp; The special proposition which Mr. Gladstone
examines is one of <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>four, the difficulties of which led Mrs. Besant to
reject Christianity&mdash;the nature of the atonement of
Christ.&nbsp; In dealing with this topic, Mr. Gladstone, after
condemning the crude utterances of some theologians and
preachers, by whom the New Testament doctrine has been travestied
and misconceived, lays down what he conceives to be the true
teaching.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is here enacted in the kingdom of
grace only repeats a phenomenon with which we are perfectly
familiar in the natural and social order of the world, where the
good, at the expense of pain endured by them, procure benefits
for the unworthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the same year appeared Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Horace.&nbsp;
It was on the whole a failure.&nbsp; A critic writes: &lsquo;The
uncouth diction, obscurity of expression of the rendering, are
patent evidences of the translator&rsquo;s being ill at ease
under the restraint of narrow bounds of rhyme and
metre.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same writer observes: &lsquo;Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s translation of the Odes of Horace will escape
oblivion.&nbsp; Historians will remember it as they remember the
hexameters of Cicero, the verses with which Frederick the Great
pestered Voltaire, and the daily poems Warren Hastings used to
read at his breakfast-table.&rsquo;&nbsp; An ingenious
contributor to <i>Blackwood</i>, on the publication of the book,
contributed a letter from &lsquo;Horace in the Shades,&rsquo;
intimating that he had nothing to do with the matter.&nbsp; It is
to be questioned whether worse verses were ever written than the
following in the &lsquo;Horace&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;No; me the feast the war employs<br />
Of maids (their nails well clipt) with boys,<br />
Me fancy free; or something warm,<br />
My playful use does no one harm.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>Again,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Then shalt thou with flagrant passion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the beasts be torn,<br />
And with fire of cankered entrails<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt grieve forlorn.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Furies grant in war no scant;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devouring seas o&rsquo;er sailors roll;<br />
Young funerals hold their place with old;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proserpine spares no breathing soul.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus is the death of Cleopatra recorded:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Bold to survey with eye serene,<br />
The void that had her palace been;<br />
She lodged the vipers in her skin<br />
Where best to drink the poison in.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When &lsquo;Ecce Homo&rsquo; appeared&mdash;a book which dear
Lord Shaftesbury, Exeter Hall applauding, described as the worst
book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell&mdash;Mr. Gladstone, in
an article in <i>Good Words</i>, gave in his adherence to the
book.&nbsp; He described the author as at once passing into the
presence of Jesus of Nazareth, and then, without any foregone
conclusion, either of submission or dissent, giving that heed to
the acts and words of the unfriended teacher which the truest
Jews did when those words were spoken and those acts done.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone found time, amid his preoccupations, to write a
long article for the <i>English Historical Review</i> on the last
portion of the &lsquo;Greville Memoirs,&rsquo; chiefly justifying
the action of the parties with which he was associated at the
time of the &lsquo;death and obsequies of Protection,&rsquo; in
1852, and during the Crimean War.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone traverses
Mr. Greville&rsquo;s statement that in 1852 the Peelites were
indisposed to join the Whigs, under the delusive belief that they
could form a <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>Government of their own.&nbsp; He can say positively
that, with the single exception of the Duke of Newcastle, none of
the party entertained this belief.&nbsp; &lsquo;They knew that
dichotomy, and not trichotomy, was for our times the law of the
nation&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Their sympathies in regard to
economy and peace lay rather with one of the Liberal wings than
with the main body.&nbsp; In some cases they were divided between
their Liberal opinions and their Conservative traditions and
associations.&nbsp; For many a man to leave the party in which he
was brought up is like the stroke of a sword dividing bone and
marrow.&nbsp; But the intermediate position is essentially a
false position, and nothing can long disguise its
falseness.&nbsp; The right hon. gentleman confesses that he
himself frankly stated to Lord Derby that the Peelites were a
public nuisance, for while rapid migrations from camp to camp may
be less creditable, slow ones not only are more painful, but are
attended with protracted public inconvenience.&nbsp; The lessons
of this political drama, he says&mdash;and the statement is
significant at the present time&mdash;are of the present and the
future.&nbsp; It entails a heavy responsibility to embark
political parties in controversies certain to end in defeat where
there is a silent sense of what is coming&mdash;a latent
intention to accept defeat&mdash;and where the postponement of
the final issue means only the enhancement of the price to be
paid at the close.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone deprecates the tone
generally assumed in speaking of the Crimean War.&nbsp; He denies
the assumptions that we drifted into that war; that the Cabinet
of the day was in continual conflict with itself at the various
stages of the negotiations; and that if it had adopted a bolder
course at an earlier stage the Emperor <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Nicholas
would have succumbed.&nbsp; The first of these assertions he
characterizes as untrue, the second as ridiculous, and the third
as speculative and highly improbable.&nbsp; Lord Clarendon did
say that we drifted into war; but his meaning was simply that the
time of war had not come, but the time of measures for averting
it had expired; and Lord Clarendon, not less expressively than
truly, said that, while the intermediate days were gliding by, we
were drifting into war.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the fable is
brazen-fronted, and, like Pope Joan, still holds her
place.&rsquo;&nbsp; As regards the Cabinet, Mr. Gladstone has
witnessed much more sharp or warm argument in almost every other
of the seven Cabinets to which he has had the honour to
belong.&nbsp; In regard to the assumption that the war was not
justifiable, he makes the &lsquo;inconvenient admission&rsquo;
that those who approved of the war at the time approved of it on
very different grounds.&nbsp; Some favoured it as an Arthurian
enterprise, the general defence of the weak against the strong;
some because they had faith in the restorative energies of
Turkey, if time were obtained by warding off the foe; some
thought the power of Russia was exorbitant, and dangerous to
Europe and to England.&nbsp; This last was the sentiment which
most captivated the popular imagination.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
feeling, and not argument, that raised the Crimean War into
popularity.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is feeling, Mr. Gladstone thinks,
which has plunged it into the abyss of odium.&nbsp; The war
proceeded, as he conceives, upon a more just and noble idea
expressed by Lord Russell when, on the outbreak of hostilities,
he denounced the Emperor Nicholas as &lsquo;the wanton disturber
of the peace of Europe.&rsquo;&nbsp; The policy which led <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>to the war
was a European protest against the wrongdoing of a single
State.&nbsp; His belief is that, compared with most wars, the war
of 1854&ndash;56 will hold in history no dishonourable
place.&nbsp; For its policy must be regarded <i>&agrave; parte
ante</i>.&nbsp; He confesses, however, that the result of the war
was exceedingly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>The May number of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, 1887,
contained an article by Mr. Gladstone reviewing the fifth and
sixth volumes of Mr. Lecky&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of England in
the Eighteenth Century.&rsquo;&nbsp; Towards the conclusion of
the article Mr. Gladstone quotes the following sentence:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Lecky writes as follows: &ldquo;We have seen a
Minister going to the country on the promise that if he was
returned to office he would abolish the principal direct tax paid
by the class which was then predominant in the
constituencies.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>This sentence refers, of course, to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
promise in his election address in 1874 to repeal the income
tax.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone replies that Mr. Lecky seems to be
unaware that it is the practice of candidates for a seat in
Parliament to announce to those whose votes they desire their
views on political questions, either pending, proximate, or
sometimes remote.&nbsp; He proceeds:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The accusing sentence is inaccurately written.&nbsp; In
January, 1874, the date to which it refers, there was no question
of returning to office.&nbsp; I addressed a constituency as
Minister, and in a double capacity as Chancellor of the Exchequer
and as head of the Administration, proposed to repeal the income
tax.&nbsp; But it is also untruly written.&nbsp; It is untrue
that the payers of income tax were then the predominant class <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>in the
constituencies.&nbsp; In Ireland, the payers of income tax had
ceased, since the ballot was introduced, to rule elections.&nbsp;
In England and Scotland, a very large majority of members were
returned by the towns.&nbsp; In the towns, then as now, household
suffrage was in full force, and the voters were as a body more
independent of the wealthy than are the rural population.&nbsp;
The repeal of the income tax, whether proper or improper in
itself, was not then a thing improper in respect of the persons
to whom it was announced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been held by some that there should never be an
appeal to the people by a Ministry on the subject of
taxation.&nbsp; But why not?&nbsp; The rights of the people in
respect to taxation are older, higher, clearer, than in respect
to any other subject of government.&nbsp; Now, appeals on many
such subjects have been properly made&mdash;on Reform in 1831; on
the China War in 1857; on the Irish Church in 1868; on Home Rule
in 1886; lastly, in 1852, by the Tories, whose creed Mr. Lecky
appears in other matters to have adopted, on the finance proper
to be proposed by Mr. Disraeli after, and in connection with, the
repeal of the Corn Law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Undoubtedly, although right in principle, such appeals
and promises are eminently liable to abuse.&nbsp; But there is
one touchstone by which the peccant element in them may be at
once detected.&nbsp; If the promise launches into the far future,
it may straightway be condemned.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, it
is one certain to be tested within a few weeks, the case is
different.&nbsp; A Minister casually pitchforked, so to speak,
into office, and living from hand to mouth, might be tempted to a
desperate venture.&nbsp; But can Mr. Lecky <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>suppose
that the Ministry of 1868&ndash;74, which had outlived the
ordinary term, and (may it be said?) had made its mark in
history, would thus have gambled with false coin, and have sought
to add so ignobly, and with such compromise of character, a
respite almost infinitesimal to its duration?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was the engagement to the repeal of the income tax one
either obligatory or proper in itself?&nbsp; Was the time well
chosen?&nbsp; Was the proposer morally bound to the
proposal?&nbsp; I will answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to all these
questions, and I will prove my affirmative, though my short
recital will lead Mr. Lecky, if he reads it, into a field of
contemporary history which it is quite plain that he has never
traversed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1895 it was announced that Mr. Gladstone had written a book
on &lsquo;The Psalter, according to the Prayer-book
Version.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was commenced by Mr. Gladstone many
years before, but it was not till his retirement from office that
he found time to finish it.&nbsp; He also compiled a Concordance,
and added a series of notes on the Psalter.&nbsp; In the same
year the address on the Armenian question, which was delivered by
Mr. Gladstone at Chester, was republished in pamphlet form by Mr.
Fisher Unwin.</p>
<p>I may not omit to refer to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s utterance on
the first chapter of Genesis&mdash;that sublime exordium to the
Bible&mdash;that its truth is in all respects as fresh to-day as
it was in the hour of its first enunciation, and that it links
the Church of Adam, Abraham, and Moses in living fellowship and
unity to the Church of to-day.</p>
<p>In 1894 Mr. Gladstone republished certain papers, which had
already appeared in various periodicals, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>under the
title of &lsquo;Studies Subsidiary to the Works of Bishop
Butler.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ridicules critics such as Matthew Arnold,
who held that the &lsquo;Analogy&rsquo; is dead, with the
eighteenth-century Deism it opposed.&nbsp; He labours to show
that it is as applicable to the religious problems of to-day as
to those a hundred years old.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Analogy,&rsquo; he
holds, is one of the finest of intellectual disciplines.&nbsp; In
the study of Butler&rsquo;s works the student finds himself in an
intellectual pal&aelig;stra, where his best exertions are
required thoroughly to grapple with his teacher.&nbsp; Mainly,
education is a process of wrestling, and it is best to wrestle
with the highest masters.&nbsp; The chapters on the Censors of
Butler shows all the ex-Premier&rsquo;s skill at fence.&nbsp; On
the subject of the Theology of Butler, Mr. Gladstone attributes
his habit of drawing it straight from the Scriptures, with little
reference to authorities, as due to his Nonconformist
education.&nbsp; In reply to the charges that the
&lsquo;Analogy&rsquo; tended to Romanism, he asks for a single
known case where the study of Butler had led to Rome.&nbsp; The
chapter on the influence of Butler is of great interest.&nbsp; In
his second part Mr. Gladstone is occupied largely with an
elaborate discussion, on the lines laid down by Butler, on the
future life, and the condition of man therein.&nbsp; He is
especially severe on the Universalists.&nbsp; He regards a period
of future discipline for imperfect natures, &lsquo;not without an
admixture of salutary and accepted grace,&rsquo; as in accord
with both faith and reason.&nbsp; The remaining chapters on
Determinism, Teleology, Miracle, and Probability are the toughest
in the whole book, and are as hard to understand as Butler
himself.&nbsp; On miracles Mr. Gladstone follows the orthodox
lines.</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s latest utterances on the subject of
Christianity appeared in 1895.&nbsp; He pleads for an eternity of
punishment.&nbsp; His latest article on the subject appeared in
the American Pictorial Bible.&nbsp; The following passage, in
which he surveys the world, is worth reprinting: &lsquo;The
Christian religion,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is for mankind the
greatest of all phenomena.&nbsp; It is the dominant religion of
the inhabitants of this planet in at least two important
respects.&nbsp; It commands the largest number of professing
adherents.&nbsp; If we estimate the population of the globe at
1,400,000,000&mdash;and some would state it at a higher
figure&mdash;between 400 and 500 of these, or one-third of the
whole, are professing Christians; and at every point of the
circuit the question is not one of losing ground, but of gaining
it.&nbsp; The fallacy which accepted the vast population of China
as Buddhists in the mass has been exploded, and it is plain that
no other religion approaches the numerical strength of
Christianity&mdash;doubtful, indeed, if there be any other which
reaches one-half of it.&nbsp; The second of the particulars now
under view is perhaps more important.&nbsp; Christianity is the
religion in the command of whose professors is lodged a
proportion of power far exceeding its superiority of numbers, and
this power is both moral and material.&nbsp; In the area of
controversy it can be said to have hardly an antagonist.&nbsp;
Force, secular or physical, is accumulated in the hands of
Christians in a proportion almost overwhelming, and the
accumulation of influence is not less remarkable than that of
force.&nbsp; This is not surprising, for all the elements of
influence have their home within the Christian precinct.&nbsp;
The art, the literature, the systematic industry, invention, and
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>commerce&mdash;in one word, the forces of the world are
almost wholly Christian.&nbsp; In Christendom alone there seems
to be an inexhaustible energy of world-wide expansion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion, we give a couple of extracts from Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s more recent articles of universal
interest.&nbsp; In one he makes a noble contribution to the
praise of books.&nbsp; &lsquo;Books are,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;the voices of the dead.&nbsp; They are a main instrument
of communion with the vast human procession of the other
world.&nbsp; They are the allies of the thought of men.&nbsp;
They are in a certain sense at enmity with the world.&nbsp; Their
work is, at least, in the two higher compartments of our
threefold life.&nbsp; In a room well filled with them no one has
felt or can feel solitary.&nbsp; Second to none, as friends to
the individual, they are first and foremost among the
<i>compages</i>, the bonds and rivets of the race.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But books want housing and arranging, and they are multiplying so
rapidly that they threaten to get beyond all control.&nbsp; In an
article in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, from which we quote the
above, Mr. Gladstone, with a light-hearted relish of the subject
it is pleasant to see, gives some of his ideas on the subject of
arrangement.</p>
<p>Another extract will give us his ideas of the Jews.&nbsp; He
thinks that the purport of the Old Testament can be best summed
up in the words that it is a history of sin and redemption.&nbsp;
After explaining that the narrative of the Fall is in accordance
with the laws of a grand and comprehensive philosophy, and that
the objections taken to it are the product of narrower and
shallower modes of thought, he proceeds, passing by the story of
the Deluge and the dispersion, to consider the selection of
Abraham.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he asks, &lsquo;were the <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Jews
selected as the chosen people of God?&rsquo;&nbsp; Not, he
thinks, because of their moral superiority.&nbsp; He contrasts
the Jewish ethics and those of the Greeks, considerably to the
detriment of the former, and then sums up the matter as follows:
&lsquo;Enough has perhaps been said to show that we cannot claim
as a thing demonstrable a great moral superiority for the Hebrew
line generally over the whole of the historically known
contemporary races.&nbsp; I, nevertheless, cannot but believe
that there was an interior circle, known to us by its fruits in
the Psalter and the prophetic books, of morality and sanctity
altogether superior to what was to be found elsewhere, and due
rather to the pre-Mosaic than to the Mosaic religion of the
race.&nbsp; But it remains to answer with reverence the question,
Why, if not for a distinctly superior morality, nor as a full
religious provision for the whole wants of man, <i>why</i> was
the race chosen as a race to receive the promises, to guard the
oracles, and to fulfil the hopes of the great Redemption?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The answer may, I believe, be conveyed in moderate
compass.&nbsp; The design of the Almighty, as we everywhere find,
was to prepare the human race, by a varied and a prolonged
education, for the arrival of the great Redemption.&nbsp; The
immediate purposes of the Abrahamic selection may have been to
appoint, for the task of preserving in the world the fundamental
bases of religion, a race which possessed qualifications for that
end decisively surpassing those of all other races.&nbsp; We may
easily indicate two of these fundamental bases.&nbsp; The first
was the belief in one God.&nbsp; The second was the knowledge
that the race had departed from His laws&mdash;without which
knowledge how should they welcome a Deliverer whose object it was
to bring <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>them back?&nbsp; It may be stated with confidence that
among the dominant races of the world the belief in one God was
speedily destroyed by polytheism, and the idea of sin faded
gradually but utterly away.&nbsp; Is it audacious to say that
what was wanted was a race so endowed with the qualities of
masculine tenacity and persistency, as to hold over these
all-important truths until that fulness of time when, by and with
them, the complete design of the Almighty would be revealed to
the world?&nbsp; A long experience of trials beyond all example
has proved since the Advent how the Jews, in this one essential
quality, have surpassed every other people upon earth.&nbsp; A
marvellous and glorious experience has shown how among their
ancestors before the Advent were kept alive and in full vigour
the doctrine of belief in one God and the true idea of sin.&nbsp;
These our Lord found ready to His hand, essential preconditions
of His teaching.&nbsp; And in the exhibition of this great and
unparalleled result of a most elaborate and peculiar discipline
we may perhaps recognise, sufficiently for the present purpose,
the office and work of the Old Testament.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In another article Mr. Gladstone objects to Universalism as a
contradiction of Divine utterance.&nbsp; He writes: &lsquo;To
presume on overriding the express declarations of the Lord
Himself delivered upon His own authority, is surely to break up
revealed religion in its very ground-work, and to substitute for
it a flimsy speculation spun like a spider&rsquo;s web by the
private spirit, and as little capable as that web of bearing the
strain by which the false is to be severed from the
true.&rsquo;&nbsp; Speaking of the theory which denies future
punishment, he says: &lsquo;What is this but to emasculate all
the sanctions <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>of religion, and to give wickedness, already under a
too feeble restraint, a new range of license?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is vain to seek to chronicle Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
publications.&nbsp; Even at the time of his last illness he was
said to have been engaged in a work on the Fathers.&nbsp; His
writings fill six columns in the library catalogue of the British
Museum.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">ANECDOTAL AND CHARACTERISTIC.</span></h2>
<p>No one has been the subject of so much small talk as Mr.
Gladstone.&nbsp; He has been a fortune to the men who think it
creditable to write gossip and twaddle for newspapers in London
or the provinces.&nbsp; In 1881 all England was interested, or
supposed to be so, in the tale of his hat.&nbsp; A writer says:
&lsquo;The House of Commons has not had such a laugh for years as
it had to-day over Mr. Gladstone and his hat.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone
is singular among members in never bringing a hat into the
assembly.&nbsp; He would not wear it when his head was broken,
but preferred a skull-cap.&nbsp; But it is the rule that after a
division is called nobody shall address the Speaker standing, or
with his head uncovered.&nbsp; To-day Mr. Gladstone wished to say
something after the division-bell had rung, but no sooner did he
open his mouth than the whole House yelled for him to observe the
law.&nbsp; He sought for a hat, but could find none, the House
still roaring at him.&nbsp; At length one of his colleagues got
hold of Sir Farrer Herschell&rsquo;s hat and put it on him.&nbsp;
Now, Sir Farrer is a small man among small men, and he has a
small head for a small man.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, if not <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>exactly a
giant, has the head of one.&nbsp; Imagine him, then, with Sir
Farrer&rsquo;s hat upon his head.&nbsp; A mountain crowned by a
molehill could not have looked more ridiculous.&nbsp; The House
laughed and roared at Mr. Gladstone, and Mr. Gladstone laughed at
himself.&nbsp; Everybody voted this the sublimest spectacle of
the session.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas! Mr. Gladstone too often lent
himself in Parliament to being exhibited.&nbsp; To draw Gladstone
was at one time a favourite sport among the young men of the
Opposition.&nbsp; Nothing was easier.&nbsp; You had only to get
up and misquote Mr. Gladstone, and the fiery old man was on his
legs in an instant.</p>
<p>In the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i> Mr. W. R. Lucy in
1892 gave an interesting analysis of Mr. Gladstone
intellectually.&nbsp; He writes: &lsquo;In addition to a
phenomenal physical constitution, Nature has been lavish to Mr.
Gladstone in other ways.&nbsp; Education, association, and
instinct early led him into the political arena, where he
immediately made his mark.&nbsp; But there are half a dozen
professions he might have embarked upon with equal certainty of
success.&nbsp; Had he followed the line which one of his brothers
took, he would have become a prince among the merchants of
Liverpool.&nbsp; Had he taken to the legal profession, he would
have filled the courts of law with his fame.&nbsp; Had he entered
the Church, the highest honours would have been within his
grasp.&nbsp; If the stage had allured him, the world would have
been richer by another great actor&mdash;an opportunity, some of
his critics say, not altogether lost under existing
circumstances.&nbsp; With the personal gifts of a mobile
countenance, a voice sonorous and flexible, and a fine presence,
Mr. Gladstone possesses dramatic instincts frequently brought
into <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>play in House of Commons debates or in his platform
speeches.&nbsp; In both his tendency is rather towards comedy
than tragedy.&nbsp; It is the fashion to deny him a sense of
humour, a judgment that could only be passed by a superficial
observer.&nbsp; In private conversation his marvellous memory
gives forth from its apparently illimitable stores an appropriate
and frequently humorous idea of the current topic.&nbsp; If his
fame had not been established on a loftier line, he would have
been known as one of the most delightful conversationalists of
the day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Robertson, of Venice, having sent Mr. Gladstone a
copy of his second edition of &lsquo;Fra Paolo Sarpi,&rsquo; in
returning thanks from Hawarden, Mr. Gladstone writes: &lsquo;I
have a strong sympathy with men of his way of thinking.&nbsp; It
pleases me particularly to be reminded of Gibbon&rsquo;s weighty
eulogy upon his history.&nbsp; Ever since I read it&mdash;I think
over forty years ago&mdash;I have borne to it my feeble testimony
by declaring that it comes nearer to Thucydides than any
historical work I have ever read.&nbsp; It pleases me much to
learn that a Sarpi literature has appeared lately at
Venice.&nbsp; If you were so good as to send the titles of any of
the works or all works on the subject, I would order them; and I
should be further glad if you would at any time thereafter come
and see them in a library with hostel attached, which I am
engaged in founding here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the London clubs to which Mr. Gladstone belonged was
that known as Grillions, where it was the custom when a member
dined there alone to record the event in verse.&nbsp; In 1882 Mr.
Gladstone dined at the club alone, and, having written as
chairman in the <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>club-book &lsquo;one bottle of champagne,&rsquo; added
the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The mind is its own place, and in itself<br
/>
Can make a heaven of hell&mdash;a hell of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Lord Houghton, as poet-laureate of the club, added
some verses, commencing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Trace we the workings of that wondrous
brain,<br />
Warmed by a bottle of our dry champagne.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1891 the <i>Literary World</i> wrote: &lsquo;There have
been comments made lately by different writers depreciating Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s literary judgments.&nbsp; Whatever else may be
said for them, it is certain, we think, that they are not hastily
formed, for in his reading, as in all else, he is strictly
methodical.&rsquo;&nbsp; This point is well made by a contributor
to the <i>Young Man</i>, in a long and interesting article.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;cannot read hastily,
nor has he ever acquired the fine art of skipping.&nbsp; But he
is not slow to discover whether the book is worth reading, and if
not, after a few pages it is cast on one side, though, as a
general rule, his judgment is lenient.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the
&lsquo;Autobiography of Sir Henry Taylor&rsquo; this is further
illustrated.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone on one occasion asked him what
he thought of two or three volumes of poetry recently
published.&nbsp; They were presentation copies sent him by
obscure poets, who, if possessed of a grain or two of
common-sense, could have had but little expectation that their
volumes would be opened by Mr. Gladstone, even if they should
pass beyond the sifting hands of his secretaries.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
seemed, however, to be prepared to discuss their merits, had not
my entire ignorance,&rsquo; writes Sir Henry, &lsquo;stopped the
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another characteristic is mentioned by Sir Henry on <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the
authority of Mrs. Gladstone&mdash;the power he possessed of
turning from what was arduous and anxious, and becoming at once
intensely occupied with what was neither, and she regarded this
as having something of a saving virtue.&nbsp; But she added,
nevertheless, it was a frightful life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;s method of impartiality is,&rsquo;
wrote Lord Houghton, &lsquo;to be furiously earnest on both sides
of a question.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, we have another characteristic
from Lord Houghton&mdash;Gladstone saying &lsquo;he felt strongly
that the statesman was becoming every day more and more the
delegate of the people and less the leader.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another characteristic incident is recorded by Mr. Richard
Redgrave: &lsquo;Mr. Lowe said that a few days before, dining
with Mr. Gladstone, a lady being seated between them, Mr.
Gladstone across said to Mr. Lowe: &ldquo;I cannot think why they
called Cobden the Inspired Bagman.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither
can I,&rdquo; said Mr. Lowe; &ldquo;for he was neither inspired
nor a bagman.&nbsp; In fact, it reminds me of a story told of
Madame Maintenon when someone offered to obtain an order for her
to gain admission into the <i>Maison des filles
repenties</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Madame, &lsquo;I am
neither a <i>fille</i> nor am I a
<i>repentie</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; At that the lady between the
two politicians burst into a laugh, but Mr. Gladstone pulled
rather a long face,&rsquo; as he did, I am told by a late
Minister, at a dinner where Lord Westbury uttered some rather
coarse jokes.</p>
<p>The late Mr. R. H. Hutton, of the <i>Spectator</i>, in an
article in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, smartly hit off one of
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s characteristics: &lsquo;There is a story
that one of his most ardent followers said of him that he did not
at all object to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s always <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>having one
ace up his sleeve, but he did object to his always saying that
Providence placed it there.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1832 a Dean of
Peterborough said of Mr. Gladstone: &lsquo;His conscience is too
tender ever to run straight.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1866 Dr. Lake, of
Durham, remarked of Mr. Gladstone that &lsquo;his intellect could
persuade his conscience of anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the course of life,&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone wrote to
Sir Henry Taylor, &lsquo;I have found it just as difficult to get
out of office as to get in, and I have done more doubtful things
to get out than to get in.&nbsp; Furthermore, for more than nine
or ten months of the year I am always willing to go, but in the
two or three which precede the Budget I begin to feel an itch to
have the handling of it.&nbsp; Last summer I should have been
delighted [to resign]; now I am indifferent.&nbsp; In February,
if I live so long, I shall, I have no doubt, be loath, but in
April quite ready again.&nbsp; Such are my signs of the
Zodiac.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the series of sketches of &lsquo;Bookworms of Yesterday and
To-day,&rsquo; place in the <i>Bookworm</i> is given to Mr.
Gladstone, who has been a book-collector for over three-quarters
of a century.&nbsp; &lsquo;He kindly informs me,&rsquo; writes
Mr. W. Roberts, &lsquo;that he has two books which he acquired in
1815, one of which was a present from Miss H. More.&nbsp; At the
present time he estimates his library to contain from 22,000 to
25,000 books, arranged by himself into divisions and sections in
a very minute manner.&nbsp; The library is so exceedingly
miscellaneous that Mr. Gladstone himself does not venture to
state which section preponderates, although he thinks that
&ldquo;theology may be one-fourth.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are about
twenty editions of Homer, and from thirty to forty translations,
whole or part.&nbsp; He has never <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>sympathized to any considerable
extent with the craze for modern first editions, but &ldquo;I
like a tall copy&rdquo; is Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reply, made with
all the genuine spirit of the true connoisseur, to an inquiry on
the subject.&nbsp; And so far as regards a preference for ancient
authors, in old but good editions, to modernized reprints, the
verdict is emphatically in favour of the former.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Shaftesbury seems to have been struck with Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s inconsistency.&nbsp; In his diary, in 1873, he
writes: &lsquo;Last year Gladstone, speaking on Female Suffrage,
said &ldquo;the Bill will destroy the very foundation of social
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; This year he says: &ldquo;We had better defer
it till we get the ballot; then it will be quite
safe.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1864 his lordship had written:
&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone will succumb to every pressure except the
pressure of a constitutional and Conservative party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. W. Lucy thus illustrates Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
restlessness: &lsquo;Except at the very best, Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s Parliamentary manner lacked repose.&nbsp; He
was always brimming over with energy, which had much better have
been reserved for worthier objects than those that sometimes
succeeded in evoking its lavish expenditure.&nbsp; I once
followed Mr. Gladstone through the hours of an eventful sitting.
. . .&nbsp; The foe opposite was increasing in the persistence of
his attack, and nominal friends on the benches were growing weary
in their allegiance.&nbsp; The Premier came in from behind the
chair with hurried pace; he had been detained in Downing Street
up to the last moment.&nbsp; As usual, when contemplating making
a great speech, he had a flower in his button-hole, and was
dressed with unusual care.&nbsp; Striding swiftly past his
colleagues on the <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Treasury Bench, he dropped into the seat kept vacant
for him, and, hastily taking up a copy of the orders, ascertained
what particular question in the long list had been reached.&nbsp;
Then turning with a sudden bound of his whole body, he entered
into animated conversation with a colleague, his pale face
working with excitement, his eyes glistening, and his right hand
vehemently beating the open palm of his left hand, as if he were
literally pulverizing an adversary.&nbsp; Tossing himself back
with equally rapid gesture, he lay passive for the space of
eighty seconds.&nbsp; Then with another swift movement of the
body he turned to the colleague on the left, dashed his hand into
his side-pocket, as if he had suddenly become conscious of a live
coal secreted there, pulled out a letter, opened it with a
violent flick of extended forefingers, and earnestly discoursed
thereon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In acknowledging a copy of a recently published work on
&lsquo;Clergymen&rsquo;s Sore Throat,&rsquo; Mr. Gladstone has
addressed a letter to the author, Dr. E. B. Shuldham, on the
subject of the management of the voice in public speaking.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No part of the work,&rsquo; writes Mr. Gladstone,
&lsquo;surprised me more than your account of the various
expedients resorted to by eminent singers.&nbsp; There, if
anywhere, we might have anticipated something like a fixed
tradition.&nbsp; But it seems we have learned nothing from
experience, and I myself can testify that even in this matter
fashion prevails.&nbsp; Within my recollection an orange, or more
than one, was alone, as a rule, resorted to by members of
Parliament requiring aid.&nbsp; Now it is never used.&nbsp; When
I have had very lengthy statements to make I have used what is
called egg-flip&mdash;a glass of sherry beaten up with an <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>egg.&nbsp;
I think it excellent, but I have much more faith in the egg than
in the alcohol.&nbsp; I never think of employing it unless on the
rare occasions when I have expected to go much beyond an
hour.&nbsp; One strong reason for using something of the kind is
the great exhaustion often consequent on protracted expectation
and attention before speaking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the best of the many stories connected with Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s many residences in the South of France tells
how one Sunday he and his wife were seated in the church at
Cannes near the pulpit.&nbsp; The Grand Old Man, turning to his
wife, said, in an irritable tone: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
hear.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind, my dear,&rsquo; said the
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go to sleep; it will do you much more
good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a chapter of his autobiography Mr. Gladstone wrote:
&lsquo;In theory, and at least for others, I am a purist with
respect to what touches the consistency of statesmen.&nbsp;
Change of opinion in those to whom the public look more or less
to assert its own is an evil to the country at large, though a
much smaller one than their persistency in a course which they
know to be wrong.&nbsp; It is not always to be blamed, but it is
to be watched with vigilance&mdash;always to be challenged and
put upon trial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1881 Mr. Gladstone told the electors of Leeds he had been a
Liberal since 1846.&nbsp; The fact is, as Mr. Jennings has shown,
that he held office under a Conservative Premier, that he was
returned for Oxford as a Conservative, and that in 1858 he
canvassed the county of Flint for Sir Stephen Glynne, who was a
strong supporter of Lord Derby&rsquo;s Government.</p>
<p>In 1855, when Lord Aberdeen, who was certainly <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>no Whig,
retired, Mr. Gladstone wrote a most effective letter of regret,
which incidentally throws a little light on his
correspondent&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone writes:
&lsquo;You make too much of services I have rendered you.&nbsp; I
wish it were in my power to do justice in return for the benefits
I have received from you.&nbsp; Your whole demeanour has been a
living lesson to me, and I have never gone, with my vulnerable
temper and impetuous moods, into your presence without feeling
the strong influence of your calm and settled spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Pearson&rsquo;s Magazine</i> tells some interesting things
about the Grand Old Man.&nbsp; Though possessing strict views on
Sunday observance, he does not disapprove of Sunday
cycling.&nbsp; The bicycle, he says, is no more than a perfect
means of locomotion.&nbsp; Hawarden Park, which is closed to
ordinary tourists on Sunday, is open to cyclists.&nbsp; He gives
the first place among living writers of fiction to Zola, but his
favourite English books are the Waverley Novels.&nbsp; Of his
once large collection of axes only thirty or forty now
remain.&nbsp; &lsquo;In bygone days admirers were constantly
sending him axes as marks of their esteem, and now other admirers
quite as constantly smuggle them away as treasured mementoes of
their visits.&rsquo;&nbsp; A silver pencil, axe-shaped, presented
by the Princess of Wales &lsquo;for axing questions,&rsquo; is
among the treasures of the G.O.M.&nbsp; Fifty or sixty
walking-sticks, part of a once unique collection, adorn a rack
outside Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s study, but the number of these also
&lsquo;is being diminished by visitors whose enthusiasm is in
advance of their scruples.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alluding to Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s fondness for fresh air, the writer (Mr. W. A.
Woodward) <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>says: &lsquo;I have seen him, with Mrs. Gladstone at
his side, a ridiculously small umbrella held between them, set
forth for a pleasure drive in such torrents of rain as no
ordinary mortal would have faced save on some vital
purpose.&rsquo;&nbsp; Books on divorce and marriage&mdash;judging
by the number of annotations in his neat, distinct handwriting in
such volumes in his library&mdash;receive his closest attention,
but he has no very great interest in the modern analytical
novel.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is natural,&rsquo; says the writer,
&lsquo;that the subject of marriage, in its middle relation to
politics and religion, should have exercised a large fascination
over so ardent a student of theology and sociology.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone planted a young tree at Studley Royal, and the
Studley and Oldfield children were specially summoned to the
place to witness the ceremonial.&nbsp; As they were standing in
review order&mdash;there being in all about one hundred and
twenty youngsters&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone passed down the
lines, and some remarks by the right hon. gentleman were
addressed to Lord Ripon.&nbsp; The point mainly dwelt upon was
the large size of the heads of Yorkshire children.&nbsp; Mr.
Gladstone suggested that it was indicative of independence.&nbsp;
He added that his experience was that the farther north he went,
the larger he found the human head, and he told an anecdote about
a man who went to a hatter&rsquo;s, but failed to get a hat large
enough, until the tradesman, driven to desperation, called for an
Aberdeen hat.</p>
<p>It is well known that Mr. Gladstone is an authority in the
ceramic art, and he never loses an opportunity of inspecting rare
and beautiful specimens.&nbsp; When he lately visited Manchester
he spent an early hour at the <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>exhibition among the beautiful
collection placed there by Messrs. Doulton.&nbsp; And there he
received an unexpected pleasure.&nbsp; More than a dozen years
ago, when speaking at a dinner of the Turners&rsquo; Company, he
alluded to a visit he had made to the works of Messrs.
Doulton.&nbsp; He had been taken into the room of a young man,
who happened to be absent at the time, to see the quality of his
workmanship.&nbsp; He was delighted with what he saw, the more
when he learned that the young artist had not heard a sound since
his fourth year.&nbsp; He spoke so kindly of him and his work
that it almost seemed as if Mr. Gladstone envied the isolation
which seemed to favour abstraction and study in the midst of
bustle and din.&nbsp; It was this gentleman, Mr. Frank Butler,
whom Mr. Gladstone found in charge of the Doulton art treasures
at Manchester.&nbsp; He at once remembered him, and, before
leaving, he had Mr. Butler to seat himself at the potter&rsquo;s
wheel, and fashion before him a vase as a specimen of his
skill.&nbsp; Upon this Mr. Gladstone inscribed his name in the
wet clay, and another was turned for Mrs. Gladstone.</p>
<p>From a little volume&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone in the Evening
of his Days&rsquo;&mdash;I take the following:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another reason why Mr. Gladstone gets through such an
astounding amount of work is his extraordinary habit of using up
odds and ends of time.&nbsp; One day not long ago he was driving
into Chester after luncheon; his pudding was very hot, so he went
away from table, changed his clothes, got ready for his drive,
and came back and finished the meal, thus saving the ten minutes
during which his pudding cooled.&nbsp; It may here be mentioned,
in connection with the drives to Chester, that on the day a few
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>months
ago when he drove in for the purpose of making his powerful
Armenian speech, Mr. Gladstone had been absorbed in Butler all
the morning, and the speech was made without any special
preparation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even at the great age of eighty-five it
was evident that Mr. Gladstone worked more hours a day than many
men in the prime of life would like.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Doyle once asked Mr. Gladstone whether, after his
long years of practice, he ever felt nervous on rising to
speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not on political questions,&rsquo; was his
answer; &lsquo;but if I am called upon to deliver what the Greeks
used to call an &ldquo;epideictic oration,&rdquo; as at the
Literary Fund dinner, or the like, I am often somewhat troubled
at first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just heard,&rsquo; wrote on one occasion a
correspondent of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, &lsquo;a highly
characteristic anecdote of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
versatility.&nbsp; I suppress the name and place.&nbsp; After an
interesting interview with a prominent author, whose acquaintance
he had newly made, in reply to a courteous hope that his health
and strength might long be spared, Mr. Gladstone said:
&ldquo;Yes, I confess I wish to live for two great objects.&nbsp;
You can guess one of them: it is to settle the Irish
question.&nbsp; The other is, to convince my countrymen of the
substantial identity between the theology of Homer and that of
the Old Testament.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under this heading we give a few items from Bishop
Wilberforce&rsquo;s notes.&nbsp; In 1868 he writes:
&lsquo;Gladstone noble as ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again:
&lsquo;Gladstone, as ever, just, earnest, and honest, as unlike
the tricky Disraeli as ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again the Bishop
writes, after staying with him at Hatfield: &lsquo;I have very
much enjoyed meeting Gladstone.&nbsp; He is so delightfully
true&mdash;just as full of interest <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>in every good thing of every kind,
and exactly the reverse of the mystery man.&nbsp; When people
talk of Gladstone going mad, they do not take into account the
wonderful elasticity of his mind and the variety of his
interests.&nbsp; Now, this morning after breakfast he and I and
Salisbury went a walk round the beautiful park, and he was just
as much interested in the size of the oaks, their probable age,
etc., as if no care of State ever pressed upon him.&nbsp; This is
his safeguard, joined to rectitude of purpose and clearness of
view.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No reference to Mr. Gladstone would be complete without a word
about his collars.&nbsp; In a paper on the subject in the <i>New
Century</i>, Mr. Harry Furniss writes: &lsquo;I believe I am
generally supposed to have invented Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
collars; but, as a matter of fact, I merely sketched them.&nbsp;
Many men wear collars quite as large, and even larger, than his,
but they are not so prominent in appearance, for the simple
reason that when Mr. Gladstone sits down it is his custom to sit
well forward; his body collapsed, so to speak, and his head sunk
into his seat.&nbsp; The inevitable result was that his collar
rose, and owing to this circumstance I have frequently seen it
looking quite as conspicuous as it is depicted in my
caricatures.&nbsp; When Mr. Gladstone upon one occasion met the
artists of <i>Punch</i> at dinner, I was chagrined to find when
he walked into the dining-room that he had discarded his usual
large collar for one of the masher type.&nbsp; I felt that my
reputation for accuracy was blighted, and sought consolation from
the editor of a Gladstonian organ who happened to be
present.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he is evidently
dressed up to meet the <i>Punch</i> artists.&nbsp; He is the pink
of fashion and neatness now; but last night when I met him at <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>dinner his
shirt was frayed at the edges, and his collar was pinned down
behind, but the pin gave way during the evening, and the collar
nearly came over his head.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Justin McCarthy has much to say of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
eyes: &lsquo;I am myself strongly of opinion that Mr. Gladstone
strongly improved in appearance as his life went on deepening
into years.&nbsp; I cannot, of course, remember him as he was in
1833.&nbsp; I think I saw him for the first time some twenty
years later.&nbsp; But although he was a decidedly handsome man
at that time, I did not think his appearance was nearly so
striking or so commanding as it became in the closing years of
his career.&nbsp; I do not believe that I ever saw a more
magnificent human face than that of Mr. Gladstone after he had
grown old.&nbsp; Of course, the eyes were always superb.&nbsp;
Many a stranger looking at Mr. Gladstone for the first time saw
the eyes, and only the eyes, and could think for a moment of
nothing else.&nbsp; Age never dimmed the fire of these
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few characteristics are given by Mr. McCarthy: &lsquo;I have
mixed,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;with most of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s contemporaries, his political opponents as well
as his political followers, and I have never heard a hint of any
serious defect in his nature, or of any unworthy motive
influencing his private or public career.&nbsp; Defects of
temperament, and of manner, and of tact have no doubt been
ascribed to him over and over again.&nbsp; He was not, people
tell me, always successful in playing up to or conciliating the
weaknesses of inferior men.&nbsp; He was not good, I am told, at
remembering faces or names. . . .&nbsp; Such defects, however, in
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s nature or temperament count indeed for
little or <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>nothing in the survey of his career.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Another characteristic of Mr. Gladstone, remarks Mr. McCarthy, is
his North-country accent.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Clark, who was Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s physician for
years, said he never had a more docile patient than Mr.
Gladstone.&nbsp; The moment he is really laid up he goes to bed,
and there remains till he recovers.&nbsp; He is a firm believer
in the doctrine of lying in bed when you are ill.&nbsp; You keep
yourself in an equable temperature, avoid the worries and
drudgery of everyday life, and being in bed is a good pretext for
avoiding the visits of the multitude of people whose room is
better than their company.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s admirers are very angry when it is
intimated that his character is not perfection.&nbsp; It may be
there are spots in the sun, but the idol of the party must be
spotless.</p>
<p>The following anecdote illustrates Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s love
of music.&nbsp; On the eve of one of his great budgets, Mr.
Gladstone found time to go to the theatre to see Sarah Bernhardt
act in &lsquo;Ph&egrave;dre.&rsquo;&nbsp; The great statesman was
so delighted with the acting, that he wrote to mademoiselle a
letter expressing his great gratification.&nbsp; The divine Sarah
always had a great influence on the impressionable Premier.&nbsp;
When she held a reception, the first to come and the last to go
was Mr. Gladstone, and none who witnessed it were likely to
forget the spectacle of the great statesman bending low almost
till he kissed the hand of the actress when she advanced to
welcome him.</p>
<p>According to all accounts, Mr. Gladstone is on the most
friendly terms with his tenantry.&nbsp; To some of them he has
been specially kind.&nbsp; On the occasion of <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>the
marriage of his son and heir he feasted 550 of his cottage
tenants on the first day, and upwards of 400 on the second.&nbsp;
On one occasion, while Mr. Gladstone was pointing out to a large
party of excursionists the beauties of the trees, he added:
&lsquo;We are very proud of our trees.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
then, do you cut them down as you do?&rsquo; said a man in the
crowd.&nbsp; Said the Grand Old Man in reply: &lsquo;We cut down
that we may improve.&nbsp; We remove rottenness that we may
restore health by letting in air and light.&nbsp; As a good
Liberal, you ought to understand that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again I give an anecdote of his kindness as landlord.&nbsp;
When Mr. Gladstone was engaged in one of his Midlothian
campaigns, his principal tenant, an energetic and capable
practical farmer, was suffering from severe illness.&nbsp; Every
day during the campaign came a letter from Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone
inquiring after his health.&nbsp; On their return from Scotland,
having travelled all night, they drove from Chester straight to
the tenant&rsquo;s house, and were both in his bedroom at
half-past eight in the morning.</p>
<p>Another Hawarden anecdote may be recorded here.&nbsp; In Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s household was an old woman-servant, who had a
son inclined to go wrong.&nbsp; The mother remonstrated, but all
to no purpose.&nbsp; At last she thought if the Premier would
take the prodigal in hand, at last he might be reclaimed.&nbsp;
She appealed to Mr. Gladstone, and he responded at once to her
appeal.&nbsp; He had the lad sent to his study, spoke to him
words of tender advice and remonstrance, and eventually knelt
down with him and prayed to a higher Power to help in the work of
reformation.</p>
<p>In May, 1885, Mr. Lucy writes: &lsquo;In making a statement <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>to-night on
the course of public business, the Premier spoke, as has been a
matter of custom of late, amid continuous noisy interruptions
from a section of the Conservative party.&nbsp; To-night this
method of Parliamentary procedure, novel, as directed against the
leader of the House, reached a climax which had the desired
effect of temporarily silencing the Premier.&nbsp; After a
painful pause, he observed that this new kind of Parliamentary
warfare was of little matter to him, whose personal interposition
in political strife was a question of weeks rather than of
months, certainly of months more than of years.&nbsp; But he had
a deep conviction that within the last three years a blow had
been struck at the liberty and dignity of the House of Commons by
these intrusions upon debate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No notice can be held to be complete which does not give one
an idea of the splendid physical constitution which has enabled
Mr. Gladstone to lead the life he has led and to do the work he
has done.&nbsp; On one occasion he told his Welsh admirers that
it was due to the air of that part of the Principality near which
he resided.&nbsp; But his vitality is undoubtedly an illustration
of the principle of heredity.&nbsp; The medical journals had
always much to say of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; We
quote one.&nbsp; At the end of the session in which Mr. Gladstone
carried his Irish Land Bill, the <i>Lancet</i> wrote:
&lsquo;Apart from all party and political considerations, it is
but proper to express our satisfaction at seeing Mr. Gladstone,
at the end of a session almost unprecedented for length and for
those influences which harass and exhaust, in a state of
admirable health and spirits.&nbsp; It was a physiological and
psychological marvel last week to see him rise and show reasons
for <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>disagreeing with the Lords&rsquo; Amendments, not in
any hasty or excited mood, but with perfect serenity of intellect
and temper, with absolute mastery of details, and appealing to
all that was best in his opponents.&nbsp; This is a feat which
exceeds, in our judgment, the felling of many trees, and almost
crowns Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s many claims to distinction.&nbsp;
The last straw breaks the camel&rsquo;s back, and it would have
been excusable if the obstructions of August had elicited
peevishness and intelligible if they had produced
exhaustion.&nbsp; But both strength and temper are intact, and
Mr. Gladstone goes to his holiday with a stock of energy which
many younger men would be glad to return with, and which is no
mean guarantee for future service to his Queen and
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Archbishop Magee used to tell a good story of Father Healy and
Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; The latter asked him upon what principle the
Roman Church offered soul indulgences, saying when he was in Rome
he was offered an indulgence for fifty francs.&nbsp; Father Healy
replied: &lsquo;Well, Mr. Gladstone, I do not want to go into
theology with you; but all I can say is, that if my Church
offered you an indulgence for fifty francs, she let you off very
cheap!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A correspondent, a well-known London minister, who got crushed
in the crowd at the opening of St. Martin&rsquo;s Free Library,
in 1891, by Mr. Gladstone, tells an anecdote of the
ex-Premier&rsquo;s kindness of heart, on the authority of a
former vicar.&nbsp; When Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr.
Gladstone regularly attended this church.&nbsp; A
crossing-sweeper in the parish, who had been some time ill, when
asked by the vicar if anybody had been to see him, said,
&lsquo;Yes, sir; Mr. <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Gladstone.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Which
Mr. Gladstone?&rsquo; he was asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; was
the answer, &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone himself.&nbsp; He often speaks
to me, and gives me something at my crossing.&nbsp; Not seeing
me, he asked my mate, who was keeping it for me, why I was not
there.&nbsp; He told him I was ill, and then he asked where I
lived.&nbsp; So he came to see me, and talked and read to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a characteristic big gathering, deserving to be
recorded here, at the National Liberal Club, in celebration of
Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone&rsquo;s golden wedding.&nbsp; In all there
were nearly 2,000 guests, and these included most of the Liberal
leaders, and at least one distinguished Liberal Unionist (Sir
John Lubbock), who, when perceived among the throng, received the
welcome of a cordial cheer.&nbsp; The chief feature of the
proceedings was the presentation of the handsome commemorative
album&mdash;a remarkable work of art&mdash;to the ex-Premier in
the reading-room.&nbsp; The scene here was a particularly
brilliant one; and when Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone appeared among the
throng, accompanied by several members of the family, there was
an outburst of enthusiasm which was continued to an unwonted
length.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reply to the address was not
long; it was a feelingly-uttered expression of
gratification.&nbsp; Only a few sentences were occupied with
political allusions.&nbsp; They declared that Liberal principles
were not of destruction, but of improvement.</p>
<p>These are a few of the sentences of thanks: &lsquo;I am
ashamed,&rsquo; said Mr. Gladstone, &lsquo;of the kindness that
has been shown me.&nbsp; (&ldquo;No.&rdquo;)&nbsp; When I speak
of my wife, when I acknowledge that there is greater justice in
the tributes that you have so kindly paid to her, <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>I there
enjoy a relative and a comparative freedom, and no words that I
could use would ever suffice to express the debt that I owe her
in relation to all the offices that she has discharged on my
behalf, and on the behalf of those who are near and dearest to
us, during the long and happy period of our conjugal union.&nbsp;
(Cheers.)&nbsp; I hope it will not sound like
exaggeration&mdash;it is really a phrase dictated by my desire to
express what I feel&mdash;if I say that I feel myself to be, as
it were, drowned in an ocean of kindness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other day Canon Scott Holland, in a touching sermon,
described Mr. Gladstone as &lsquo;spending his life in
benedictions to those whom he leaves behind in this world, and in
thanksgiving to God, to whom he rehearses over and over again,
day after day, Newman&rsquo;s hymn of austere and splendid
admiration.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here is the hymn:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Praise to the Holiest in the height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the depth be praise:<br />
In all His words most wonderful;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most sure in all His ways!</p>
<p>&lsquo;O loving wisdom of our God!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all was sin and shame,<br />
A second Adam to the fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the rescue came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O wisest love! that flesh and blood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which did in Adam fail,<br />
Should strive afresh against their foe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should strive and should prevail;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that a higher gift than grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should flesh and blood refine,<br />
God&rsquo;s Presence and His very Self,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Essence all-divine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O generous love! that He who smote<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In man for man the foe,<br />
The double agony in man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For man should undergo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&lsquo;And in the garden secretly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the cross on high,<br />
Should teach His brethren and inspire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To suffer and to die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At other times Mr. Gladstone has been known to say that his
favourite hymns were &lsquo;Rock of Ages&rsquo; and the version
of &lsquo;Dies Ir&aelig;&rsquo; which Scott introduced into
&lsquo;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;That day of wrath, that dreadful day,<br />
When heaven and earth shall pass away,<br />
What power shall be the sinner&rsquo;s stay?<br />
How shall he meet that dreadful day?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gladstone, according to a writer in the <i>Daily News</i>,
once remarked that he had made a careful study of all
Toplady&rsquo;s hymns, but had only found four other good lines
in the whole of them.&nbsp; To those who have ever heard Mr.
Gladstone recite these four lines, as he was often used to do,
the recollection will come just now with pathetic poignancy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lord! it is not life to live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Thy Presence Thou deny,<br />
Lord! if Thou Thy presence give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no longer death&mdash;to die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns Mr. Gladstone did not greatly
care.&nbsp; He considered them much over-rated.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
he wrote more than Homer,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Gladstone once;
&lsquo;7,000 hymns of thirty lines each, say; do the sum,
gentlemen, and be appalled.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. GLADSTONE&rsquo;S LETTERS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Hawarden,<br />
&lsquo;<i>July</i> 2, 1886.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Bright</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to be compelled again to address you.&nbsp;
In your speech you charge me with having successfully concealed
my thoughts last November.&nbsp; You ought to have known that
this was not the fact, for in reply to others, from whom this
gross charge was more to be expected than from you, I pointed out
last week that on the 9th November, in Edinburgh, I told my
constituents that if the Irish elections went as was expected,
the magnitude of the subject they would bring forward would throw
all others into the shade, and that it &ldquo;went down to the
very roots and foundations of our whole civil and political
constitution&rdquo; (&ldquo;Midlothian Speeches,&rdquo; 1885, p.
44).&nbsp; 2. You say I have described a conspiracy now existing
in Ireland as marching through rapine to the break-up of the
United Kingdom.&nbsp; This also is contrary to the fact.&nbsp; In
1881 there was, in my opinion, such a conspiracy against the
payment of rent and the union of the countries, and I so
described it.&nbsp; In my opinion, there is no such conspiracy
now, nor anything in the least <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>degree resembling it.&nbsp; You put
into my mouth words which, coming from me, would be absolute
falsehood.&nbsp; 3. You charge me with a want of frankness,
because I have not pledged the Government to some defined line of
action with regard to the Land Purchase Bill.&nbsp; A charge of
this kind is, between old colleagues and old friends, to say the
least, unusual.&nbsp; Evidently you have not read the Bill or my
speech on its introduction, and you have never been concerned in
the practical work of legislation on difficult and complicated
subjects.&nbsp; The foundation of your charge is that on one of
the most difficult and most complicated of all subjects I do not,
in the midst of overwhelming work, formulate at once a new course
or method of action without consulting the colleagues to whom I
am so much bound, and from whom I receive invaluable aid.&nbsp;
It might, I think, have occurred to you, as you have been in the
Cabinet, that such a course on my part would have been indecent
and disloyal, and that I should greatly prefer to bear all the
charges and suspicions which you are now unexpectedly the man to
fasten upon me.&nbsp; 4. You state you are convinced it is my
intention to thrust the Land Purchase Bill upon the House of
Commons.&nbsp; If I am a man capable of such an intention, I
wonder you ever took office with one so ignorant of the spirit of
the Constitution and so arbitrary in his character.&nbsp; Though
this appears to be your opinion of me, I do not think it is the
opinion held by my countrymen in general.&nbsp; You quote not a
word in support of your charge; it is absolutely untrue.&nbsp;
Every candidate, friendly or unfriendly, will form his own view,
and take his own course on the subject.&nbsp; We must consider to
the best of our power <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>all the facts before us, but I
certainly will not forego my right to make some effort to amend
the dangerous and mischievous Land Purchase Law passed last year
for Ireland, if such effort should promise to meet
approval.&nbsp; I have done what I could to keep out of
controversy with you, and, while driven to remonstrate against
your charges, I advisedly abstain from all notice of your
statements, criticisms, and arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Always yours sincerely,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">W. E. Gladstone</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this Mr. Bright replied two days afterwards as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Bath,<br />
&lsquo;<i>July</i> 4, 1886.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Gladstone</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry my speech has so greatly irritated
you.&nbsp; It has been as great a grief to me to speak as I have
spoken as it can have been to you to listen or to read.&nbsp; You
say it is a gross charge to say that you concealed your thoughts
last November.&nbsp; Surely, when you urged the constituencies to
send you a Liberal majority large enough to make you independent
of Mr. Parnell and his party, the Liberal party and the country
understood you to ask for a majority to enable you to resist Mr.
Parnell, not to make a complete surrender to him.&nbsp; You
object to my quotations about a conspiracy &ldquo;marching
through rapine to the breakup of the United Kingdom,&rdquo; and
you say there is now no such conspiracy against the payment of
rent and the union of the countries.&nbsp; I believe there is now
such a conspiracy, and that it is expecting and seeking its
further success through your measures.&nbsp; You complain <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>that I
charge you with a want of frankness in regard to the Land
Purchase Bill.&nbsp; You must know that a large number of your
supporters are utterly opposed to that Bill.&nbsp; If you tie the
two Bills together, their difficulty in dealing with them will be
much increased and their liberty greatly fettered.&nbsp; I think
your friends and your opponents and the country have a right to
know your intentions on so great a matter, when you are asking
them to elect a Parliament in your favour.&nbsp; Your language
seems to me rather a puzzle than an explanation, and that of your
colleagues, though contradictory, is not much clearer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have done what I could to keep out of controversy with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have not urged any man in Parliament, or out
of it, to vote against you.&nbsp; I have abstained from speaking
in public until I was in the face of my constituents, who have
returned me unopposed to the new Parliament, and to them I was
bound to explain my opinion of, and my judgment on, your Irish
Bills.&nbsp; I stand by what I have said, and shall be surprised
if the new Parliament be more favourable to your Irish measures
than the one you have thought it necessary to dissolve.&nbsp;
Though I thus differ from you at this time and on this question,
do not imagine that I can ever cease to admire your great
qualities or to value the great services you have rendered to
your country.</p>

<p>At the St. Asaph Diocesan Conference the following letter,
addressed by the Premier to Dr. Hughes, Bishop of St. Asaph, was
read by Canon Wynne Edwards:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&lsquo;Hawarden Castle,<br />
&lsquo;<i>October</i> 19, 1884.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Lord Bishop</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I undertook to contribute a letter (in default of
personal attendance) towards the work of the Diocesan Conference,
I did not anticipate the autumnal controversy in which the
political world is now engulfed, and I fear that any attempt I
now make to redeem a pledge given under other circumstances will
be poor and inadequate, even in comparison with what it might
otherwise have been, from the cares and distractions which the
controversy daily brings upon me.&nbsp; At the same time, I had
not even at the outset any ambitious plan before me.&nbsp; I did
not prepare to enter on the wide field of argument respecting the
disestablishment of the Church&mdash;too vast for my available
time; too polemical for one who has already more than enough of
polemical matter on his hands (a laugh).&nbsp; Will it
come?&nbsp; Ought it to come?&nbsp; Must it come?&nbsp; Is it
near, or is it somewhat distant or indefinitely remote?&nbsp; All
these are questions of interest which I could not touch with
advantage unless it be a single point.&nbsp; Whether
Disestablishment would be disastrous or not, I think it clear
that there is only one way in which it might come to be
disgraceful.&nbsp; That one way parts into two.&nbsp;
Disestablishment would be disgraceful if it were due to the
neglect, indifference, or deadness of the Church
(applause).&nbsp; But this is a contingency happily so improbable
that for present purposes it may be dismissed without
discussion.&nbsp; It might also be disgraceful were it to arrive
as a consequence of dissensions among the members of the Church
(hear, hear).&nbsp; This, as it appears to me, would be an
unworthy termination of a controversy which ought to be settled
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>upon far
higher grounds (applause).&nbsp; The particular &ldquo;duty of
Churchmen with regard to Disestablishment,&rdquo; which I shall
try in few words to set forth, is the duty of taking care that
dissensions from within shall not bring the Establishment to its
end (applause).&nbsp; The last half-century has been a period of
the most active religious life known to the Reformed Church of
England.&nbsp; It has also been the period of the sharpest
internal discord.&nbsp; That discord has of late been materially
allayed, not, I believe, through the use of mere narcotics, not
because the pulse beats less vigorously in her veins, but through
the prevalence in various quarters of wise counsels, or, in other
words, the application to our ecclesiastical affairs of that
common-sense by which we desire that our secular affairs should
always be governed (applause).&nbsp; What I wish now to urge is
this.&nbsp; In the fact that such discord has prevailed there is
not&mdash;nay, even were it to rise again into exasperation there
ought not to be&mdash;ground for religious despondency or
dismay.&nbsp; Divergence is to be expected, not only in all
things human, but in all things divine which wear things human
for their habiliment; and there were particular reasons why it
was to be anticipated and to be patiently borne within the Church
of England.&nbsp; We have still to look it in the face as an
incident of our history, though it may lie less heavily upon us
than in some former years as a present embarrassment.&nbsp; It
is, under all circumstances, a cause of pain and a source of
danger, but not always a demonstrative proof of weakness.&nbsp;
On the contrary, when profoundly felt and yet borne, so to speak,
without breach of continuity, it may be a test and a proof of
strength (applause).&nbsp; In every <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>living organism, in every
institution or system, its health will depend upon the
equilibrium of the elements out of which it is composed; but the
maintenance of this equilibrium is more easy when the system is
uniformly simple and its tendencies determinate and clear; more
difficult when it is many-sided and when it aims at binding
together and at directing towards a common end tendencies which
are naturally divergent, and which more commonly find for
themselves homes altogether severed.&nbsp; Let me borrow an
illustration from the world of politics.&nbsp; Discord is
comparatively rare and slight in a political club, because a
political club is an institution formed to maintain some scheme
of opinion current at the time and familiarly apprehended, though
its tests be but rough, by those who join it.&nbsp; But the
Houses of Parliament, in which these rival systems have to dwell
together and to work themselves out into common results, are and
must be the homes of frequent and serious contention.&nbsp; In
the sixteenth century the Continental Churches of the West north
of the Alps and Pyrenees were for the most part broken into rival
bodies, fiercely contending with one another, but within
themselves representing respectively one of the two great
tendencies of the period.&nbsp; To these tendencies I will not
give a theological name, but will call them those of the
Reformation and the counter-Reformation respectively.&nbsp; From
the time of the Council of Trent and of Loyola the Church of Rome
represented more strictly than it had done before the tendencies
of counter-Reformation.&nbsp; The Reformed Church had partly in
the letter, and yet more in the spirit, broken with the previous
constitution of the Church as well as with her dogma.&nbsp; Their
confessions <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>were indeed complex, but were framed upon a basis which
their members felt, or at least thought they understood.&nbsp;
They had all become in different degrees less like legislatures
and more like clubs; that is to say, in the points to which I
refer.&nbsp; A considerable time elapsed accordingly before the
Latin Church was again seriously troubled with theological
quarrels within its own domain; so also the Protestant Churches
on the Continent underwent far less of trouble from internal
dissensions than did the Church of England.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the Scandinavian countries we may almost say such
trouble has been unknown; the reason is, I apprehend, that in
each case the hostile elements had been in the main suppressed or
expelled by the struggle of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; Within
this island it was not so.&nbsp; Both in England and in Scotland
the effort was not only made, but tenaciously persisted in, to
maintain the external unity of the nation in a common religious
profession.&nbsp; I may here drop the case of Scotland, which has
found a solution of its own.&nbsp; It is enough to speak of the
case of England.&nbsp; It presents a result at first sight
paradoxical in this respect&mdash;that the Church, which among
reformed communions had least broken with tradition and most
maintained the framework of the ancient authority, was the most
perplexed, and indeed convulsed, with controversies and with
schisms.&nbsp; When the matter is examined the cause is not far
to seek.&nbsp; Weingarten, a German writer, lays down the
proposition that the Reformation, as a religious movement, took
its shape in England not in the sixteenth century, but in the
seventeenth.&nbsp; The sixteenth century made <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>the Church
and the nation independent, and established the external
framework of an ecclesiastical policy; but it seems difficult to
show that the religion now professed as national in England took
its rise at that epoch otherwise than as a legal and national
profession.&nbsp; It seems plain that the great bulk of those
burned under Mary were Puritans.&nbsp; Under Elizabeth we have to
look, I believe (with very rare and remarkable exceptions), among
Puritans or among recusants for the exhibition of an active and
definite religious life.&nbsp; A strong pressure from without
bound together a heterogeneous mass.&nbsp; In the region of
theology I apprehend that what is termed Anglicanism began with
Hooker&mdash;an authority still so high amongst us that none
disown him, and a writer whose work is said by Walton to have
attracted the laudatory admiration of the reigning Pope.&nbsp;
But the body to which Hooker belonged also contained Cartwright,
and contained, too, men of the same opinion.&nbsp; These internal
differences ripened after a time into convulsion, tyranny, and
revolution.&nbsp; I cannot severely blame those who overset
Episcopacy for their oversetting, nor those who brought it back
for their bringing it back.&nbsp; The contending elements could
not live together in the same dwelling upon tolerable
terms.&nbsp; Every effort was made to devise schemes of
comprehension, and every effort failed.&nbsp; It was better, I
suppose, that the rival partisans should part than that they
should carry the country onward from one revolution to
another.&nbsp; They parted in Scotland by casting out Episcopacy
at the Revolution.&nbsp; They parted in England legally at the
Restoration, and morally when a series of subsequent experiences
had shown that the system then established by <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>law was the
only one in which the bulk of the nation could be content to
abide (applause).</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what was the operation thus effected?&nbsp; It was
a drastic process, but a process far less drastic than those of
the sixteenth century.&nbsp; On the one side or the other it so
far enabled the Church of England to fulfil the conditions of a
corporate life and unity that it has now been maintained during
two centuries and a quarter without either the unmitigated
dualism or the agonies of convulsion which had marked the
previous experience, and with this general result: that at the
present hour the hopes of the Church of England are higher and
more buoyant than perhaps they have ever been (applause).&nbsp;
It has been very far indeed from an heroic history.&nbsp; Not
only defect but scandal has abounded.&nbsp; These things,
however, are beside the present purpose, which aims at pointing
out that when uniformity was finally brought by law into the
Church of England, still much room for diversity was
left&mdash;room enough to invite polemical criticism, but perhaps
not more than, on the one hand, the inestimable value of the
principle of liberty required, or than, on the other hand, the
teaching office of the Church could without vital injury
allow.&nbsp; She is still working out her system by experience,
but still not without this note, that the strife of parties,
although softened of late, is still somewhat sharp within
her.&nbsp; When it is said that the Church is comprehensive, the
true meaning seems to be that her history, which has, of course,
determined her character, has tended to comprise within her
limits a greater diversity of views than have usually been so
brought together.&nbsp; What may be called the Puritanical
element, rejected at the Restoration, <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>began slowly to reassert itself in
the latter half of the eighteenth century, and is now admitted to
have brought about a great revival of religious life in the
English Church (applause).&nbsp; A form of thought to which the
name of Broad may be applied seems to have been more than
tolerated in some conspicuous instances by Laud, and acquired
solidity in the universities at last after the Restoration.&nbsp;
On the other hand, as regards the Romeward tendency (so to term
it) of the Church of England, there is some evidence (though not
free from suspicion) in the curious life of Lady Williams, to
show that the chief English bishops of that era took a very
mitigated view of their doctrinal differences from the Roman
Church; and Barillon, the Ambassador of Louis XIV., writes to his
Court in the reign of James II. that the Anglican prelates were
preferable to the Jansenist Bishops of the Roman Communion.&nbsp;
I will not attempt to bring these illustrations (in which I am
relying upon memory only) down to the present day.&nbsp; Enough,
I think, has been said to show that the Church of England has
been all along peculiarly liable on the one side and on the other
both to attack and to defection, and that the probable cause is
to be found in the degree in which, whether for worldly or for
religious reasons, it was attempted in her case to combine
divergent elements within her borders.&nbsp; If there be any
truth in this rough and very incomplete historical sketch, the
conclusions to be drawn from it as regards my present purpose are
clear and simple, for it at once appears that the great maxim
<i>In omnibus caritas</i>, which is so necessary to temper all
religious controversy, ought to apply with a tenfold force to the
conduct of the members of the Church of <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>England in
respect to differences among themselves.&nbsp; They ought, of
course, in the first place to remember that their right to differ
is limited by the laws of the system to which they belong; but
within that limit should they not also, each of them, recollect
that his antagonist has something to say?&mdash;that the
Reformation and the counter-Reformation tendencies were, in the
order of Providence, placed here in a closer juxtaposition than
anywhere else in the Christian world; that a course of destiny so
peculiar appears to indicate on the part of the Supreme Orderer a
peculiar purpose; that not only no religious, but no considerate
or prudent, man, should run the risk of interfering with such a
purpose; that the great charity which is a bounden duty
everywhere in these matters should here be accompanied and upheld
by two ever-striving handmaidens of a great reverence and a great
patience; that instead of the bitterness, I might almost say the
savagery, which has too often characterized our inward
contentions, they ought on every ground of history and reason to
be peculiarly marked by moderation, mildness and reserve
(applause), by thinking no evil, by hoping all things, by kindly
and favourable interpretations (applause), and if the demand thus
made upon the evangelical resources of human nature seem to be
over-large, is it not warranted?&nbsp; Is it not eminently
rational at a time when, on the one hand, the deepest and widest
questions of belief in a Saviour, in a Deity, and in a moral law,
are everywhere coming to issue on a scale hitherto without
example; and when, on the other hand, this great organization
within which our lot has been cast is from day to day exhibiting
here and beyond the seas not only a remarkable material <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>extension,
but a growing vigour of inward life, and an increasing abundance
in every work of mercy, of benevolence, and of true civilization?
(applause).&nbsp; In concluding these remarks, I will only say
that I have, in writing them, endeavoured to place myself at a
point of view which is impersonal, impartial and historical, and
that I have not knowingly wounded the susceptibilities or
assailed the opinions of anyone who may read them (loud
applause).</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, with great respect, my dear Lord Bishop,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Yours most faithfully,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">W. E. Gladstone</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of St. Asaph.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the subsequent proceedings the letter was frequently
referred to as a magnificent letter, and as one worthy of the
Premier&rsquo;s transcendent abilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord E. Fitzmaurice, complimenting him
upon a speech which he delivered at Old Cumnock, in
Ayrshire.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was pre-eminently,&rsquo; said the
ex-Premier, &lsquo;the speech that was wanted, made by one who
was &ldquo;in all respects peculiarly the man to make
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In my view,&rsquo; proceeded Mr. Gladstone,
&lsquo;Ireland is the heading of a bright chapter in the history,
not only of the Liberals, but especially of the Whigs.&nbsp; It
was a noble thing on the part of Burke and Fitzwilliam and the
other seceders from Fox that not all their horror of France could
make them untrue to Ireland.&nbsp; The Whig party after the
schism remained for Irish purposes unbroken, and were right in
each one of the various stages through which the question had to
pass&mdash;right in the endeavour, frustrated <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>by Pitt and
the ascendency men, to work the Grattan Parliament; right in the
opposition to the Union when it was shamelessly forced on
Ireland; right in saying, by the mouth of Fox, that so huge a
measure must have an unprejudiced and a full trial when it had
once been effected, and when no man could undertake to say
positively that Ireland might not come, as Scotland had come, to
make it her own by adoption; right, probably, when Grattan gave
his provisional sanction to coercion as the necessary sequel to
the Union; right certainly when Lord Grey and Lord Althorp
proposed further coercion in 1834, when they had done, and were
doing, for Ireland in so many ways all which at the time they
could, and when no Minister was in a condition to say
constitutionally that the sense of the Irish people demanded
self-government; and, finally, right was a cruelly crippled
remnant of their leading class, enthusiastically supported from
first to last by a large portion of the nation, in listening to
the constitutional demand of Ireland by their representatives in
1885, and in recognising after three generations had passed away
that union with coercion&mdash;in other words, government by
force&mdash;had been tried all but too fully, and had entirely
failed.&nbsp; We want,&rsquo; continued Mr. Gladstone, &lsquo;a
little Whig treatment of Ireland.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dealing with
another aspect of the argument, which he characterized as
&lsquo;not less unacceptable and important,&rsquo; he expressed
the fear that the action of the chief part of the Whig peers and
aristocracy in severing themselves from the bulk of the Liberal
party might be to narrow the Liberal party, which had hitherto
been so broad.&nbsp; This he attributed &lsquo;entirely to the
so-called Liberal Unionists.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Liberal Unionism
has,&rsquo; he said, <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>&lsquo;tended to break up the old
and invaluable habit of Liberal England, which looked to a
Liberal aristocracy and a Liberal leisured class as the natural,
and therefore the best, leaders of the Liberal movement.&nbsp;
Thus it was that classes and masses were united.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This controversy, and the recollection, will do away with the
certain triumph of Home Rule.&nbsp; But will the ranks which have
been divided easily close up?&nbsp; &lsquo;I, for one,&rsquo;
repeated Mr. Gladstone, &lsquo;think that the narrowing of the
party by the severance or reduction of one wing is also the
crippling of the party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone had, as he himself put it, &lsquo;felt it his
duty to put Liberal candidates in possession of some means of
meeting statements&rsquo; as to his past connection with the Tory
party.&nbsp; The particular remark which elicited this letter was
made by Mr. Chatterton, the Tory candidate for the Crewe
division.&nbsp; It was that &lsquo;in his fiftieth year Mr.
Gladstone was in full sympathy with the Tory party.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Gladstone, in his letter, put forward ten propositions:
&lsquo;It is true that down to the year 1839, when I was
twenty-nine years old, I might fairly be called a Tory of the
Tories in questions relating to the Church.&nbsp; (2) It is
untrue that even at that time I could justly be so described in
other questions.&nbsp; (3) I am not aware that after 1839, or, at
all events, after 1841, I could justly be described, even in
Church questions, as a Tory of the Tories, or perhaps as a Tory
at all.&nbsp; (4) In 1843 I was denounced in the House of Lords
as being disloyal to the principles of Protection.&nbsp; (5) In
1849&ndash;50 I assisted to the best of my power the Government
of Naples.&nbsp; (6) In 1851, in company with the Peelites, the
Irish Roman Catholics, and the group led by Mr. Cobden, I
actively <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>resisted both Whigs and Tories, but the last
especially, in defence of religious liberty, on the
Ecclesiastical Titles Bill.&nbsp; (7) Unquestionably I differed
strongly from the first Government of Lord Palmerston in
1855&ndash;8, on the question of peace, of foreign policy, of
finance, and of divorce.&nbsp; The last was not a party
question.&nbsp; On the other three I believe that my opinions
were, as they are now, practically the opinions of the Liberal
party.&nbsp; (8) Lord Derby sent me to the Ionian Islands in
1858, in precisely the same sense as that in which the Government
of 1868&ndash;74 sent Lord Iddesleigh to America.&nbsp; (9) In
company with Lord Russell and Mr. Milner Gibson, I gave the vote
in 1858 on the Conspiracy Bill which brought in the Tories.&nbsp;
Like Lord Russell, after doing this, I knew it to be my duty to
give the Tories fair-play and such support as was equitable until
positive cause of difference should arise.&nbsp; (10) Before
their Italian policy was made public, I declined to join in the
vote of want of confidence which removed them from office.&nbsp;
But a few weeks later, when the volume containing it was
published, I intimated in Parliament that had I known that policy
at the time I should have pursued a different
course.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;So much,&rsquo; adds Mr. Gladstone,
&lsquo;for my Toryism down to 1859.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1876 Mr. Gladstone wrote to Hayward: &lsquo;The
<i>Times</i> appears to be thoroughly emasculated.&nbsp; It does
not pay to read a paper which next week is sure to refute what it
has demonstrated this week.&nbsp; It ought to be prohibited to
change sides more than a certain number of times in a year.&nbsp;
As to the upper ten thousand, it has not been by a majority of
that body that any of the great and good measures of our century
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>have
been carried, though a minority have done good service; and so I
fear it will continue.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone seems in 1878
to have had a poor opinion of the <i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he wrote to Blachford, &lsquo;they have
often made improper admissions, and do not drive the nail home as
it really ought to be done by a strong Opposition paper, such as
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of Derry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his address to the electors of Midlothian in 1886, Mr.
Gladstone said: &lsquo;Lord Hartington has lately and justly
stated in general terms that he is not disposed to deny our
having fallen into errors of judgment.&nbsp; I will go one step
further, and admit that we committed such errors, and serious
errors, too, with cost of treasure and of precious lives, in the
Soudan.&nbsp; For none of these errors were we rebuked by the
voice of the Opposition; we were only rebuked, and that
incessantly, because we did not commit them with precipitation,
and because we did not commit other errors greater still.&nbsp;
Our mistakes in the Soudan I cannot now state in detail; the task
belongs to history.&nbsp; Our responsibility for them cannot be
questioned; yet its character ought not to be
misapprehended.&nbsp; In such a task miscarriages were
inevitable.&nbsp; They are the proper and certain consequence of
undertakings that war against nature, and that lie beyond the
scope of human means, and of rational and prudent human action;
and the first authors of these undertakings are the real makers
of the mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In connection with this subject, let us add the following from
Gordon&rsquo;s Diary at Khartoum: &lsquo;Poor Gladstone&rsquo;s
Government! how they must love me!&nbsp; I will accept nothing
whatever from Gladstone&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>I will not
let them even pay my expenses; I will get the King to pay
them.&nbsp; I will never set foot in England again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most remarkable letters a great statesman
ever wrote was that to an American in 1862, in which Mr.
Gladstone thus shows how impossible it was for the North to put
down the South.&nbsp; He writes: &lsquo;You know, in the opinion
of Europe, that impossibility has been proved.&nbsp; Depend upon
it, to place the matter on a simple issue, you cannot conquer and
keep down a country where the women behave like the women of New
Orleans, and when a writer says they would be ready to form
regiments, were such regiments required.&nbsp; And how idle it is
to talk as some of your people do, and some of ours, of the
slackness with which the war has been carried on, and of its
accounting for the want of success.&nbsp; You have no cause to be
ashamed of your military character and efforts. . . .&nbsp; I am,
in short, a follower of General Scott; with him I say, Wayward
sisters, go in peace.&nbsp; Immortal fame be to him for his wise
and courageous advice, amounting to a prophecy.&nbsp; Finally,
you have done what man could do; you have failed because you have
resolved to do what man could not do.&nbsp; Laws stronger than
human will are on the side of earnest self-defence; and to aim at
the impossible, which in other things may be folly only when the
path of search is dark with misery and red with blood, is not
folly only, but guilt to boot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1880 some correspondence was published between Captain
Boycott and Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; The former wrote to the Prime
Minister, giving a narrative of the events which obliged him to
leave Ireland, and asked for <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>compensation from the
Government.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been prevented from pursuing my
business peaceably; where my property has not been stolen, it has
been maliciously wasted, and my life has been in hourly peril for
many months.&nbsp; I have been driven from my home, and, having
done no evil, find myself a ruined man, because the law as
administered has not protected me.&rsquo;&nbsp; In reply, Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s secretary wrote: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone has
received your letter of the 8th inst., and, in reply, desires me
to say that he is not sure in what way he is to understand your
request for assistance from her Majesty&rsquo;s Government.&nbsp;
It has been very largely afforded you in the use of the public
force; beyond this it is the duty of the Government to use its
best exertions in the enforcement of the existing law, which they
are endeavouring to effect through the courts, and by asking when
necessary the assistance of the Legislature to amend or enlarge
the law&mdash;a matter of much importance, on which you can, of
course, only receive information together with the public
generally.&rsquo;&nbsp; A little later we were informed Mr.
Gladstone declined to accede to Captain Boycott&rsquo;s claim for
pecuniary compensation on account of having to leave his farm,
holding that the large display of public force required for
Captain Boycott&rsquo;s protection having been furnished, the
State could not be expected to entertain any further claims.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone addressed the following letter to the editor of
the <i>Baptist</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have given full consideration, which is well
deserved, to your letter and article.&nbsp; I complain of <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>nothing in
the article, and am not surprised at the desires which it
expresses.&nbsp; I acknowledge the just and generous treatment
which I have had from Nonconformists both in and out of Wales;
but the same hill or valley presents itself in different forms
and tints, according to the point from which it is viewed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My point of view is that determined for me by my
political career.&nbsp; I cannot safely or wisely deal in the
affirmation of abstract resolutions, though I by no means
undertake to lay down the same rather rigid rule for
others.&nbsp; In 1868 I moved resolutions on the Irish Church,
but they were immediately followed by a Bill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your article asserts that there is now a great
opportunity for disestablishing the Welsh Church, which ought not
to be let slip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not enter into the arguments pro or con., but
will simply refer to the declarations I have made in the case of
Scotland, and then assume, <i>for argument&rsquo;s sake</i>, that
the Welsh Church ought to be disestablished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From my point of view there is now no such opportunity
at all.&nbsp; I have been telling the country on every occasion I
could find that no great political matter, of whatever kind (of
course I mean a contested matter), could be practically dealt
with until the Irish question, which blocks the way, is settled,
and so put out of the way.&nbsp; I may, of course, be wrong, but
this is my firm opinion; therefore he who wishes to have a great
Welsh question discussed in a practical manner should, as I
think, see that his first business, with a view to his own aim,
is to clear the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you may say Ireland ought not to occupy the
attention of Parliament to the exclusion of great British <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>questions.&nbsp; My answer is, that I have not stated
whether it <i>ought</i>, but have simply said that it will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, you may ask, why not defer the Irish question
until these urgent British matters are settled?&nbsp; I reply
that I have no more power thus to defer the Irish question than I
had to defer the earthquake which happened thirty-six hours ago
in France and Italy.&nbsp; Any attempt by me to force a
postponement of the Irish question would only add to the
confusion and the pressure.&nbsp; I am not creating a difficulty,
but only pointing it out.&nbsp; The finger-post does not make the
road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, however, point out a main reason why this Irish
question is so troublesome, obtrusive, and provoking.&nbsp; It is
because it involves social order, and it is in the nature of
questions involving social order to push their claims to
precedence over other questions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In conclusion, I may also observe that your letter and
article take no notice of the fact that I am in my fifty-fifth
year of public service, and appear to assume that it is my duty
to continue in such service until I drop.&nbsp; To this
proposition I must, on what appear to me solid and even high
grounds, respectfully demur.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no desire that you should consider this letter
as a secret one.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your most faithful and
obedient,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">W. E. Gladstone</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;21, Carlton House Terrace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>February</i> 25.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s secretary, writing to a correspondent in
the <i>Daily News</i> in 1885, who had asked what the clergy were
drawing from national funds, replied: &lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;<a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>Mr. Gladstone, in reply to your
letter, desires me to inform you that the clergy are not State
paid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again, to a correspondent Mr. Gladstone wrote: &lsquo;You are
mistaken in supposing that the outrages in Manchester and
Clerkenwell determined or affected my action with regard to
Ireland.&nbsp; They drew the attention of the public, on which
there are so many demands, to Irish questions, and thereby
enabled me in point of time to act in a manner for which I had
previously declared my desire.&nbsp; You state that the Irish
voters are preparing themselves to punish the Liberal
party.&nbsp; In that respect I do not see that those of whom you
speak can improve upon what they have already done; for in and
since 1874, just after that party had dealt with the questions of
Church and Land, they inflicted upon it the heaviest
Parliamentary blow it has received in my time.&nbsp; I hope,
however, from every present indication, that, notwithstanding the
mischief done to it and to the wider interests of humanity by the
Irish secession, it will, when an opportunity is allowed, prove
to have strength sufficient for the exigencies of the
time.&rsquo;</p>

235</span>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. GLADSTONE AND HIS
CONTEMPORARIES.</span></h2>
<p>In 1853 Lord Blachford wrote, just after Mr. Gladstone had
unfolded his famous Budget which took off newspapers the
additional stamp required for supplements, and imposed a single
stamp of a penny for every newspaper of whatever sort: &lsquo;If
Gladstone has anything Conservative in him, he will find it
difficult to remain in a Ministry which must eventually be thrown
upon Radical support.&nbsp; But he is really so powerful a man
that, whatever shakes and delays and loss of time there may be,
he must come up near the surface.&nbsp; I expect he will show the
best&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, most politically powerful&mdash;side of
himself as Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp; Pursuing details is
so much his power if he is only not run away with by it.&nbsp; I
think, if it is not a paradox, he has not poetry enough for the
formation of a first-rate judgment.&nbsp; He has an immense mass
of knowledge most methodically arranged, but the separate items
must be looked for in their respective boxes, and do not
combine.&nbsp; The consequence is not merely want of play, but
that crotchety, one-sided, narrowish mode of viewing a matter
uncorrected by the necessary comparisons and considerations which
people call ingenious <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>and subtle and Gladstonian.&nbsp; He
looks at the details, not at the aspects of a subject, and
masters it, I should imagine, by pursuing it hither and thither
from one starting-point, and not by walking round it; and
financial subjects will, I suppose, bear this mode of treatment
better than any other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a valuable work by a distinguished German, Dr. Geiffeken,
of which an English translation appeared in 1889, the author thus
described Mr. Gladstone: &lsquo;His eloquence shows as its
prominent quality the acuteness of intelligent methodical
thought, and a readiness which, united with the most complete
mastery of the matter, seems to require no preparation.&nbsp; He
is beyond all cavil the first speaker of his time on subjects
connected with public business, and is unsurpassed in power of
luminous presentation of complicated economic questions.&nbsp;
Relying on a memory that never fails, he knows how to impart life
to the dryest array of figures, to group them in attractive
forms, and to expound them so that his hearers may have them
completely within their grasp.&nbsp; Nor is he less able in
mastering the most involved question of law.&nbsp; His
imagination is short-winded, dry, and apt to lose itself in
speculation.&nbsp; His pathos is without warmth, his diction
lacks charm, in spite of his copious command of language, his
clear periods, and the inexhaustible staying power of his
voice.&nbsp; The most unfavourable side of him as a speaker is
seen when he begins to argue.&nbsp; Mr. Escobar never understood
so well as he how to use language against the use of language, to
involve his thoughts in clouds, to explain away inconvenient
facts, to leave himself a back-door open to escape, and to father
upon his opponents assertions which they would in nowise <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>acknowledge.&nbsp; He involves the truth so hopelessly
that it is impossible to disentangle it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Rowland Hill, in his &lsquo;Autobiography,&rsquo; writes:
&lsquo;There are few public men with whom I have not come on such
excellent terms, and from whom I have received so much kindness,
as from Mr. Gladstone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Archbishop Trench, writing to Bishop Wilberforce in 1864,
says: &lsquo;I deeply regret Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Reform speech,
which certainly may alter his future&mdash;may alter the whole
future of England.&nbsp; No man but one endowed with his genius
and virtues could effectually do mischief to the institutions of
England, but he may do it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he wrote:
&lsquo;Nothing can hinder Mr. Gladstone from being the most
remarkable man in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1859 Sir Archibald Alison, the historian, met
Mr. Gladstone at the hospitable mansion of Mr. Stirling, of Keir,
near Stirling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had been acquainted with
him,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;when he was a young man, and he had
dined once or twice at our house in St. Colome Street, but I had
not seen him for above twenty years, and in the interval he had
become a leading Parliamentary orator and a great man.&nbsp; I
was particularly observant, therefore, of his manner and
conversation, and I was by no means disappointed in either.&nbsp;
In manner he had the unaffected simplicity of earlier days,
without either the assumption of superiority which might have
been natural from his Parliamentary eminence, or the official
pedantry so common in persons who have held high office in the
State.&nbsp; In conversation he was rapid, easy and fluent, and
possessed in a high degree that great quality so characteristic
of a powerful mind, so inestimable in discoursing, of quickly
apprehending what was said on the other <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>side, and
in reply setting himself at once to meet it fairly and
openly.&nbsp; He was at once energetic and discursive,
enthusiastic, but at times visionary.&nbsp; It was impossible to
listen to him without pleasure, but equally so to reflect on what
he said without grave hesitation.&nbsp; He left on my mind the
impression of his being the best discourser on imaginative
topics, and the most dangerous person to be entrusted with
practical ones, I had ever met with.&nbsp; He gave me more the
impression of great scholastic acumen than of weighty,
statesman-like wisdom.&nbsp; Eminent in the University, and
transferred without any practical training in the school of life
at once from its shades to the House of Commons, he was like the
ecclesiastics who in Catholic countries were often transferred
direct from the cloister to the Cabinet, and began to operate on
mankind as they would do on a dead body to elucidate certain
points of physics, and who have so often proved at once the
ablest and most dangerous of governors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An able writer, Mr. Bagehot, contends Mr. Gladstone is spoilt
by applause, as follows: &lsquo;But because his achievements have
fallen so much below the standard of his expectations, because
destiny has fought against him and proved too much for him, is
Mr. Gladstone on that account dejected?&nbsp; On the contrary,
although he may experience some passing emotions of chagrin and a
pious resentment against circumstances, he cherishes the
comfortable conviction that both what he has done and what he has
abstained from doing are right.&nbsp; Facts may be against him,
but, then, so much the worse for the facts.&nbsp; His view of
foreign politics is that every male child born into the world, <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>whether
Indian or African, Mussulman, Egyptian fellah or Zulu Kaffir,
Aztec or Esquimaux, is capable of being educated into a free and
independent elector for an English borough.&nbsp; Parliamentary
institutions and representative Government are to him, not only
the supreme end at which to aim, but the r&eacute;gime to which
all nationalities are instinctively capable of adapting
themselves.&nbsp; He makes no allowance for difference of race or
climate, historical antecedents, national peculiarities.&nbsp;
Herein he displays a lack of imagination, which is more strange,
seeing that he possesses a large allowance of the imaginative
faculty in other respects, and that he is really poet first and
statistician afterwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Particular causes have combined to confirm this
defect.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone has spent his life in the House of
Commons, and cannot imagine a political system or a scheme of
popular rule without as accurate a copy as conditions permit of
the English representative Chamber.&nbsp; Again, he understands
the English people so well, he has so completely identified
himself with the ideas and aspirations of the upper class of
bourgeoisie, that he considers it scarcely worth while to attempt
to understand any other race.&nbsp; If he attempts such an
intellectual process he can only measure the unfamiliar by
reference to the familiar object.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone has drunk too deeply of the atmosphere of
idolatry and incense by which he has been surrounded.&nbsp; His
immense experience of public life, his great capacities as a
financier, his moral earnestness, his religious fervour, his
scholarship, culture, and conversational powers, have procured
for him enthusiastic worshippers in every section of the
community&mdash;<a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>among the lower classes; among the men of commerce and
business; among the Whig aristocracy, with whom he has been
educated, and who have long since seen in him the bulwark against
revolution; among the clergy of the Anglican Church and the
Nonconformist ministers; finally, among certain small and
exclusive divisions of London society itself.&nbsp; No man can
receive the homage that has fallen to the lot of Mr. Gladstone
during so many years without experiencing a kind of moral
intoxication and forming an excessive idea of his own
infallibility.&nbsp; Nor is it good for him that domestic
interposition should ward off the hostile expressions of opinions
in the newspapers not attached to his cause, but which may,
nevertheless, represent the views of a certain section of the
English people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. G. W. E. Russell, in his charming little book on
Gladstone, refers to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s speech on the Don
Pacifico debate, as illustrating his tendency &lsquo;to belittle
England, to extol and magnify the virtues and graces of other
nations, and to ignore the homely prejudice of patriotism.&nbsp;
He has frankly told us that he does not know the meaning of
prestige, and an English Minister who makes that confession has
yet to learn one of the governing sentiments of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;An old and haughty nation proud in
arms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether this peculiarity of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s mind can be
referred to the fact that he has not a drop of English blood in
his body is perhaps a fanciful inquiry; but its consequences are
plain enough in the vulgar belief that he is indifferent to the
interests and honour of the country which he has three times
ruled, and that his love for England is swamped and lost in the
enthusiasm of humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>In an
article on the Peelites in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s</i>, Professor
Goldwin Smith writes: &lsquo;Gladstone does not yet belong to
history, and the only part of his career which fell specially
under my notice was Oxford University Reform.&nbsp; He opposed
inquiry when a Commission was announced by Lord John Russell, and
afterwards, as a member of the Coalition Government, he framed
what was for that day a drastic and comprehensive measure of
reform. . . .&nbsp; It was impossible to be brought into contact
with Mr. Gladstone, even in so slight a way, without being made
sensible of his immense powers of work, of mastering and
marshalling details, of framing a comprehensive measure, and of
carrying it against opposition in the House of Commons.&nbsp; I
also saw and appreciated his combative energy.&nbsp; The Bill had
been miserably mauled in the Commons by Disraeli, with the aid of
some misguided Radicals.&nbsp; When it got to the Lords I was
placed under the steps of the throne, to be at hand if
information on details was needed by those in charge of the
Bill.&nbsp; The House seemed very full, but the Duke of Newcastle
came to me and said that he did not believe Lord Derby intended
to venture on a real opposition to the Bill, as there had not
been a strong whip on the Conservative side.&nbsp; &ldquo;In that
case,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what hinders you from reversing here
the amendments which have been carried against you in the
Commons?&rdquo;&nbsp; A conference was held in the library to
consider this suggestion, but Lord Russell, the leader of the
Commons, peremptorily vetoed it on the ground of prudence.&nbsp;
Mr. Gladstone was confined to his room by illness, but, in
compliance with my earnest prayer, the question was referred to
him.&nbsp; Next <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>day the signal for battle was hung out, and I had the
great satisfaction of looking on while a series of amendments in
committee&mdash;the Commons amendments&mdash;were reversed, and
the Bill was restored to a workable state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1868 Bishop Colenso writes: &lsquo;I had a very pleasant
letter by the last mail from Mr. Gladstone, to whom I wrote ten
months ago with reference to his language about Bishop Gray and
myself at an S.P.G. meeting at Penmaenmawr.&nbsp; He had my
letter before him for four months, as he says, but he begs me to
believe that this long interval of silence has not been due to
any indifference or disrespect; and, in short, he writes a very
kind and courteous letter, administering a little rebuke to me at
the end, &ldquo;not so much with respect to particular opinions,
as to what appears to be your method (technically so called) in
the treatment of theological questions.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Again, in 1881: &lsquo;I need not say that I am utterly
disappointed with Mr. Gladstone and Lord Kimberley, and
particularly with the tone of the <i>Daily News</i>, speaking, I
suppose, as the Government organ.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking
that the present Government has lost a great deal of its power by
the feebleness they have shown in their action with regard to
South African affairs, where, as far as I can see, they have not
righted a single wrong committed by Sir B. Frere, and only
withdrawn him under great pressure, and when he had already set
on foot further mischief.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a little while the
Bishop writes more approvingly: &lsquo;It gives us hope that
other wrongs may be redressed when Mr. Gladstone is ready, even
in the midst of defeats at Laing&rsquo;s Neck, Ingogo, and
Majuba, to hold back the hand of Great Britain <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>from
cruelly chastising these brave patriots, so unequally matched
with our power, which of course could overwhelm and crush
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Count Bismarck is reported to have said: &lsquo;If I had done
half as much harm to my country as Mr. Gladstone has done to his
country the last four years, I would not dare to look my
countrymen in the face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kinglake thus describes Mr. Gladstone: &lsquo;If he was
famous for the splendour of his eloquence, for his unaffected
piety, and blameless life, he was celebrated far and wide for a
more than common liveliness of conscience.&nbsp; He had once
imagined it to be his duty to quit a Government and to burst
through strong ties of friendship and gratitude by reason of a
thin shade of difference on the subject of white or brown
sugar.&nbsp; It was believed that if he were to commit even a
little sin or to imagine an evil thought he would instantly
arraign himself before the dread tribunal which awaited him
within his own bosom, and that his intellect being subtle and
microscopic, and delighting in casuistry and exaggeration, he
would be likely to give his soul a very harsh trial, and treat
himself as a great criminal for faults too minute to be visible
to the naked eyes of laymen.&nbsp; His friends lived in dread of
his virtues, as tending to make him whimsical and unstable, and
the practical politicians, perceiving that he was not to be
depended upon for party purposes, and was bent on none but lofty
objects, used to look upon him as dangerous, used to call him
behind his back a good man&mdash;a good man in the worst sense of
the term.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1865 Carlyle wrote: &lsquo;I had been at Edinburgh, and had
heard Gladstone make his great oration on <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Homer there
on retiring from office as Rector.&nbsp; It was a grand
display.&nbsp; I never recognised before what oratory could do,
the audience being kept for three hours in a state of electric
tension, bursting every moment into applause.&nbsp; Nothing was
said which seemed of moment when read deliberately afterwards;
but the voice was like enchantment, and the street when we left
the building was ringing with a prolongation of
cheers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he meets Gladstone at Mentone in 1867,
and thus describes him: &lsquo;Talk copious, ingenious, but of no
worth or sincerity; pictures, literature, finance, prosperities,
greatness of outlook for Italy, etc.&mdash;a man ponderous,
copious, of evident faculty, but all gone irrecoverably into
House of Commons shape; man once of some wisdom or possibility of
it, but now possessed by the Prince or many Princes of the Power
of the Air.&nbsp; Tragic to me, and far from enviable, from whom
one felt one&rsquo;s self divided by abysmal chasms and
immeasurabilities.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the passing of the measure of
Irish Church Disestablishment, Carlyle writes: &lsquo;In my life
I have seen few more anarchic, factious, unpatriotic achievements
than this of Gladstone and his Parliament in respect to such an
Ireland as now is.&nbsp; Poor Gladstone!&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he
writes: &lsquo;Ten days ago read Gladstone&rsquo;s article in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> with amazement.&nbsp; Empty as a blown
goose egg.&nbsp; Seldom have I read such a ridiculous, solemn,
addlepated Joseph Surface of a thing.&nbsp; Nothingness, or near
it, conscious to itself of being greatness almost unexampled. . .
.&nbsp; According to the People&rsquo;s William, England with
himself atop is evidently even now at the <i>top of the
world</i>.&nbsp; Against bottomless <i>anarchy</i> in all fibres
of her spiritual and <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>practical she has now a complete
ballot-box&mdash;can vote and count noses as free as air.&nbsp;
Nothing else wanted, clearly thinks the People&rsquo;s
William.&nbsp; He would ask you with unfeigned astonishment what
else.&nbsp; The sovereign thing in nature is <i>parmaceti</i>
(read ballot) for an inward bruise.&nbsp; That is evidently his
belief, what he finds believable about England in 1870.&nbsp;
Parmaceti, parmaceti&mdash;enough of him and it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This was written in 1870.</p>
<p>In 1873 the old Chelsea Sage writes more bitterly still:
&lsquo;The whole world is in a mighty fuss here about Gladstone
and his Bill (Irish Education)&mdash;the attack on the third
branch of the upas tree, and the question of what is to become of
him in consequence of it.&nbsp; To myself, from the beginning, it
seemed the consummation of contemptibilities and petty trickeries
on his part; one of the most transparent bits of thimble-rigging
to secure the support of his sixty Irish votes, the Pope&rsquo;s
brass band, and to smuggle the education violin into the hands of
Cullen and the sacred sons of Belial and the scarlet woman, I had
ever seen from him before.&rsquo;&nbsp; And again:
&lsquo;Gladstone seems to me one of the contemptiblest men I ever
looked on&mdash;a poor Ritualist, almost spectral kind of a
phantasm of a man; nothing in him but forms and ceremonies and
artistic mappings; incapable of seeing veritably any fact
whatever, but seeing, crediting, and laying to heart the mere
clothes of the fact, and fancying that all the rest does not
exist.&nbsp; Let him fight his own battle in the name of
Beelzebub, the god of Ekron, who seems to be his god.&nbsp; Poor
phantasm!&rsquo;&nbsp; When the catastrophe of 1874 came, and the
People&rsquo;s William was flung from his <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>pedestal,
the general opinion was that his star had set for ever, till he
saw who it was that the people had chosen to replace him.&nbsp;
His mind misgave him then that the greater faults of his
successor would lift Mr. Gladstone back again to a yet more giddy
eminence and greater opportunities for evil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Finally,&rsquo; remarks Mr. Froude, &lsquo;he did not
look on Mr. Gladstone merely as an orator who, knowing nothing as
it ought to be known, had flung his force into words and specious
sentiments, but as the representative of the multitudinous cants
of the age, religious, moral, political, literary; differing on
this point from other leading men, that he believed in all, and
was prepared to act on it.&nbsp; He, in fact, believed Mr.
Gladstone to be one of those fatal figures created by
England&rsquo;s evil genius to work irreparable mischief, which
no one but he could have executed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In her &lsquo;Memories of Old Friends&rsquo; Miss Caroline Fox
tells us she asked Carlyle, &lsquo;Is not Gladstone a man of
principle?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I did hope well of him
once,&rsquo; replied Carlyle, &lsquo;in 1867, and so did John
Stirling, though I heard he was a Puseyite and so forth . . . and
so I hoped something might come of him; but now he has been
declaring that England is in such a wonderfully prosperous
state&mdash;meaning that it has plenty of money in its breeches
pockets and plenty of beef in its great ugly belly.&nbsp; But
that is not the prosperity we want, and so I say to him:
&ldquo;You are not the lifegiver to England.&nbsp; I go my way;
you go yours.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Froude, in his
&lsquo;Oceana,&rsquo; testifies to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
unpopularity in the Colonies.&nbsp; At Melbourne, at the time of
the Gordon catastrophe, he writes: &lsquo;They did not love him
before, and had been at a loss <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>to understand the influence which he
had so long exercised.&nbsp; His mighty popularity must, they
thought, now be at an end.&nbsp; It could not survive a wound so
deadly in his country&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp; They were
deceived, it seems,&rsquo; adds Mr. Froude, speaking for them and
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet perhaps they were forming an opinion
prematurely which will hereafter be the verdict of mankind.&nbsp;
He, after all, is personally responsible more than any other man
for the helpless condition into which the executive
administration of the English empire seems to have
fallen.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oceana&rsquo; was published in
1886.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gladstone,&rsquo; writes Professor Fawcett, &lsquo;made
the speech of the evening.&nbsp; He is a fine speaker.&nbsp; He
never hesitates, and his action and manner are admirable.&nbsp;
In fact, in this respect he resembles Bright, but is far inferior
to Bright, in my opinion, in not condensing his matter.&nbsp;
Again, Gladstone is too subtle.&rsquo;&nbsp; On more than one
occasion Fawcett seems to have doubted the judgment of his
leader.</p>
<p>Sir E. Watkin writes: &lsquo;Sir John A. Macdonald, then Mr.
Macdonald, was once taken by me under the gallery, by special
order of the Speaker, to hear a great speech of Mr. Gladstone,
whom he had not heard before.&nbsp; When we went away I said:
&ldquo;Well, what do you think of him?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied:
&ldquo;He is a great rhetorician, but he is not an
orator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About twenty years ago Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s future career as
a Minister was predicted with singular accuracy by a very acute
observer of men and things, who had held almost every possible
office, from that of Ministerial Whip to Chancellor of the
Exchequer and Secretary of State.&nbsp; Observing from the
Peers&rsquo; Gallery <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s mismanagement
of public business when he led the House of Commons in Lord
Russell&rsquo;s short-lived second Administration, he said, in
effect: &lsquo;We are coming to new times.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone
cannot manage the House of Commons as other Ministers have done,
in the usual way, but he can force great measures through by
bringing the pressure of outside opinion to bear upon it.&nbsp;
This,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;is the way in which Mr. Gladstone
will maintain himself in power.&nbsp; We shall have one violent
proposal after another, as the means by which Mr. Gladstone may
gain or keep office.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. John Morley writes: &lsquo;He sometimes shows a singular
difficulty in apprehending what will be the average judgment even
on ordinary proceedings.&nbsp; He showed this in the mistake
concerning Sir Robert Collier&rsquo;s hardly more than colourable
qualification to be made a member of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council.&nbsp; He showed it again in a blunder of much
the same kind&mdash;the special pleader&rsquo;s kind&mdash;in the
appointment to the Ewelme Rectory of a clergyman who could only
by a strained interpretation of the usual rule be regarded as
eligible.&nbsp; He showed it more than ever in his attempt to
interpret away Lord (then Mr.) Odo Russell&rsquo;s meaning in the
language addressed by him in 1870 to Prince Bismarck on the
subject of Russia&rsquo;s action concerning the Black Sea clause
of the Treaty of Paris, and averring the
necessity&mdash;England&rsquo;s necessity&mdash;for going to war
with Russia with or without allies.&nbsp; His hasty resignation
of the leadership of the Liberal party in 1874 was a still more
important illustration of his rather erratic judgment.&nbsp; The
latest instance of it is his letter to Count Carophyl, which
shows at the <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>same time, we think, a singularly just appreciation of
the diplomatic concessions he had gained, and a singularly
inadequate one as to the importance of a proud and lofty tone as
one who writes as a spokesman of a great people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Spurgeon, writing to a Cardiff Liberal who opposes Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish policy, says:</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to Ireland, I am altogether at one with you;
especially I feel the wrong proposed to be done to our Ulster
brethren.&nbsp; What have they done to be thus cast off?&nbsp;
The whole scheme is as full of dangers and absurdities as if it
came from a madman, yet I am sure Mr. Gladstone is only doing
justice, and acting for the good of all.&nbsp; I consider him to
be making one of those mistakes which can only be made by great
and well-meaning men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a further deliverance on the question, &lsquo;in answer to
many friends,&rsquo; and expressing himself as sorry to say what
he does, liking to agree with Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Spurgeon
says:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We feel bound to express our great regret that the
great Liberal leader should have introduced his Irish
Bills.&nbsp; We cannot see what our Ulster brethren have done
that they should be cast off.&nbsp; They are in great dismay at
the prospect of legislative separation from England, and we do
not wonder.&nbsp; They have been ever our loyal friends, and
ought not to be sacrificed.&nbsp; Surely something can be done
for Ireland less ruinous than that which is proposed.&nbsp; The
method of pacification now put forward seems to us to be full of
difficulties, absurdities, and unworkable proposals.&nbsp; It is
well meant, but even the best and greatest may err.&nbsp; We
cannot look forward with any complacency to <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Ulster
Loyalists abandoned, and an established Irish Catholic Church,
and yet they are by no means the greatest evils which we foresee
in the near future, should the suggested policy ever become
fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief intercourse between the two, creditable to
each.&nbsp; In 1838 Macaulay writes: &lsquo;I found Gladstone in
the throng, and I accosted him, as we had never been introduced
to each other.&nbsp; He received my advances with very great
<i>empressement</i> indeed, and we had a good deal of pleasant
chat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1839 appeared the celebrated work on &lsquo;The State in
its Relations to the Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; Macaulay bought it,
read it, and wrote to Jeffery: &lsquo;The Lord hath delivered him
into our hands.&nbsp; I see my way to a popular and at the same
time gentleman-like critique.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again: &lsquo;I do
think I have disposed of all Gladstone&rsquo;s theories
unanswerably, and that there is not a line of the paper even so
strict a judge as Sir Robert Inglis would quarrel with as at all
indecorous.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again Macaulay says: &lsquo;I have
received a letter from Mr. Gladstone, who in generous terms
acknowledged, with some reservations, the fairness of the
article.&nbsp; &ldquo;In whatever you write,&rdquo; continues
Gladstone, &ldquo;you can hardly hope for the privilege of most
anonymous productions; but if it had been possible not to
recognise, I should have questioned your authorship in this
particular case, because the candour and single-mindedness which
it exhibits are, in one who has long been connected in the most
distinguished manner with a political party, so rare as to be
almost incredible. . . .&nbsp; In these lacerating times one
clings to everything of personal kindness, and husbands it for
the future; and if you will allow me, I shall earnestly desire to
carry <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>with me such a recollection of your mode of dealing
with a subject on which the attainment of truth, we shall agree,
materially depends on the temperament in which the search for it
is instituted and conducted.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How
much,&rsquo; writes Macaulay&rsquo;s biographer, &lsquo;this
letter pleased Macaulay is evident by the fact of his having kept
it unburned, a compliment which, except in this single instance,
he never paid to any of his correspondents.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
have seldom,&rsquo; he writes, in reply to Mr. Gladstone,
&lsquo;been more gratified than by the very kind note which I
have just received from you.&nbsp; Your book itself, and
everything that I have heard about you&mdash;though almost all my
information came, I must say, to the honour of our troubled
times, from people very strongly opposed to you in
politics&mdash;led me to regard you with respect and
goodwill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again Macaulay wrote: &lsquo;I have no
idea that he will ever acquire the reputation of a great
statesman.&nbsp; His views are not sufficiently profound or
enlarged for that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1853 Mrs. Beecher-Stowe, the far-famed author of
&lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rsquo; was in London, and dined
with Mr. Gladstone at the Duke of Argyll&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She
writes: &lsquo;He is one of the ablest and best men in the
kingdom.&nbsp; It is a commentary on his character that, although
one of the highest of the High Church, we have never heard him
spoken of among the Dissenters otherwise than as an excellent and
highly-conscientious man.&nbsp; For a gentleman who has attained
such celebrity, both in politics and theology, he looks
remarkably young.&nbsp; He is tall, with dark hair and eyes, a
thoughtful, serious cast of countenance, and is easy and
agreeable in conversation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Commercial Treaty with France was being <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>discussed,
Cobden wrote: &lsquo;Gladstone is really almost the only Cabinet
Minister of five years&rsquo; standing who is not afraid to let
his heart guide his head a little at times.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1860
Cobden wrote to Bright: &lsquo;I have told you before that
Gladstone shows much heart in this business. . . .&nbsp; He has a
strong aversion to the waste of money on our armaments.&nbsp; He
has no class feeling about the services.&nbsp; It is a pity that
you cannot avoid hurting his feelings by such sallies. . .
.&nbsp; He has more in common with you and me than any other man
of his power in Britain.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again: &lsquo;I agree with
you that Gladstone overworks himself.&nbsp; But I suspect that he
has a conscience, which is at times a troublesome partner for a
Cabinet Minister.&nbsp; I make allowances for him, for I have
never yet been able to define to my own satisfaction how far a
man with a view to utility ought to allow himself to be merged in
a body of men called a Government, or how far he should preserve
his individuality.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1862 Mr. Cobden writes:
&lsquo;Then Gladstone lends his genius to all sorts of
expenditure which he disapproves, and devises schemes for raising
money which nobody else would think of.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Cobden&rsquo;s last reference to Gladstone seems to have been at
the time of the Danish War, when he once more laments the fact
that Palmerston was still Premier and able to use all parties for
his ends.&nbsp; Cobden writes: &lsquo;With Gladstone and Gibson
for his colleagues, and with a tacit connivance from a section of
the Tories, there can be no honesty in our party life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In an &lsquo;Essay on the British Parliament&rsquo; a writer
gives the prize of eloquence to Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; It is, as he
truly says, &lsquo;Eclipse first, and the rest
nowhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone is an appreciated man, but he is <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>not
understood.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; The first duty of a pretty
woman, it has been said, is to let everyone know that she is
pretty.&nbsp; Extending that kind of code to the other sex, it is
surely the first duty of an intellectual man to be
intelligible.&nbsp; In this age there is more of the suspicion
that Mr. Gladstone is Talleyrandizing, and using his copious
vocabulary for the concealment of thought. . . .&nbsp; He sees so
much to say on all sides that he never clearly defines on which
side lies the preponderating reasoning.&nbsp; He sums up
controversies, rather than ranges himself in them.&nbsp; Debate
is with him pure debate&mdash;a division appears, in his
apprehension, rather to disfigure the proceedings. . . .&nbsp; If
Premier himself, he could ally himself on one hand with Mr.
Milner Gibson, and on the other with Mr. Spencer Walpole.&nbsp;
He is the <i>juste milieu</i> of the day, and, biding his time,
he offers to his contingent supporters &ldquo;chameleon&rsquo;s
diet&mdash;eating the air
promise-crammed.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Political
Portraits,&rsquo; by E. M. Whittey, published in 1851, p.
226.</p>
<p>Mr. Hill, in his &lsquo;Political Portraits,&rsquo; writes:
&lsquo;If Mr. Gladstone has to make up his mind while he is on
his legs whether he will or will not answer a delicate question,
he will express himself somewhat after this fashion: &ldquo;The
honourable gentleman, in the exercise of that discretion which I
should be the last to deny to any member of this House, least of
all to one so justly entitled to respect as my hon. friend, both
on account of his high personal character and his long
Parliamentary experience, has asked me whether the Government
intend to bring in a Bill for the establishment of secular
education in Ireland.&nbsp; Now, the discretion which I freely
concede to the hon. gentleman <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>in regard to the proposal of this
question, I must, as a member of the Government, reserve to
myself in considering whether or how I shall answer the
question.&nbsp; I have to consider it not only in itself, but in
regard to the time at which it is put, and the circumstances
which surround the topic.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone then,
perhaps, will say, what Lord Palmerston and Lord Russell would
have said in a single sentence, that he must decline to answer
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Count Beust said: &lsquo;Independently of the demerits and
dangers of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Home Rule scheme, he has, to my
mind, little or no excuse for introducing it, and the parallel he
draws between it and the dual system I inaugurated is utterly
fallacious.&nbsp; Agrarian agitation is the plea which he uses
for giving the Irish people a separate Parliament.&nbsp; I
believe that the agrarian system in Ireland has for centuries
been a bad one, and the land legislation of 1881&mdash;whatever
people may think of it from a moral point of view&mdash;will
unquestionably bring about good results.&nbsp; But how these
results are to be beneficially increased by giving Ireland a
separate Parliament, and handing over its government to the
avowed enemies of England, I cannot see, for one of its first
acts would be to pass laws&mdash;virtually decrees of
expulsion&mdash;against the landlords, to banish capital from the
land, and materially to aggravate the general condition of the
peasantry.&nbsp; As an old statesman, I should consider that the
establishment of an Irish Parliament, raising, as it
unquestionably would, aspirations on the part of the people to
free themselves from the English yoke, and increasing the power
of political agitators, is fraught with the gravest danger to
England.&nbsp; I cannot understand <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>Mr. Gladstone quoting
Austria-Hungary as an example, for, independently of the great
dissimilarity between the two systems, Mr. Gladstone forgets the
condition of Austria when the Hungarian Parliament was
established.&nbsp; Austria had been beaten after a short but most
disastrous war; Prussia had forbidden her any further
interference in German affairs; the country was almost in a state
of latent revolution; and an outbreak in Hungary, promoted by
foreign agents and foreign gold, with Klapka doing Count
Bismarck&rsquo;s bidding, was in the highest degree probable, and
would, had it occurred, have led to almost overwhelming
disaster.&nbsp; Knowing this, I felt bound to advise the Emperor
to accede to the views of the D&eacute;ak party, securing the
solidarity of the empire by the guarantees afforded through the
systems of delegations and joint budget.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone
cannot urge upon your House of Commons the same reasons for
granting Home Rule to Ireland.&nbsp; England has not been, and I
trust never will be, beaten as Austria had been beaten.&nbsp; No
foreign foe has been dictating terms at the gates of
London.&nbsp; No revolution is latent, and, a point also worthy
of consideration, the population of Ireland is only about five
millions, including those Protestants who are against the Home
Rule scheme, as compared with what I should think was the wish of
the great majority of the thirty millions composing the
population of Great Britain; whereas the area of Hungary is
greater than that of Austria proper, and its population is nearly
one-half of the total population of the empire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well might Count Beust ask: &lsquo;How can Mr. Gladstone use
my dualistic system as a precedent for his scheme of Home
Rule?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>Mr.
Joseph Cowen said: &lsquo;The super-subtlety of his intellect,
his faculty for hair-splitting, and his love of party warfare,
create distrust, and generate that strong sense of resentment
which exists towards him amongst a numerous section of the
community.&nbsp; If he were not so subtle he would be more
successful.&nbsp; A plain straight man like Lord Hartington, or
Lord John Russell, or Sir Stafford Northcote, impresses the
average Englishman more favourably than a curiously acute one
like the Prime Minister.&nbsp; The popular impression&mdash;that
he is an austere purist, and would not resort to any of the
tricks or wriggles that characterize ordinary party
leaders&mdash;is altogether a mistake.&nbsp; Those who are
brought in contact with the Legislature know that he can resort
to any of the devices of partizanship as readily as men who are
popularly accounted his inferiors.&nbsp; It is this
many-sidedness that leads to the different estimates that are
formed of him.&nbsp; He cannot but have felt very keenly the
death of Gordon, and the massacre that ensued on the fall of
Khartoum; yet I believe it is true that he went to the Criterion
that night to see a very second-rate comedy.&nbsp; Ordinary
persons having the responsibility that he had would not have been
able to attend a theatre at such a time.&nbsp; The other day he
laboured to impress the House of Commons with the extreme gravity
of the position of affairs with Russia, and shortly after he went
to see Miss Anderson play in &ldquo;Pygmalion and
Galatea.&rdquo;&nbsp; These sudden changes from seriousness to
seeming frivolity foster that sense of distrust which a large
number of sober Englishmen feel towards him.&nbsp; They cannot
understand how a man engaged in such grave and weighty
transactions can feel them very acutely <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>when he can
so easily throw them on one side and ignore the responsibilities
they entail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a wonderful fellow Gladstone is, after all!&rsquo;
said Mr. Disraeli one day to McCullagh Torrens.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
had a dreadful passage, I hear, coming back from Ireland, and the
moment he got on shore he began to make a speech to the Welshmen,
telling them that they were all right, and to keep so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an ardent creature!&rsquo; he exclaimed as Mr.
Gladstone rushed past them to vote on another occasion when a
division had been called for.</p>
<p>Under the date of June 8, 1885, Sir Stafford Northcote writes:
&lsquo;The great debate came off to-night. . . .&nbsp; The
result, a majority of twelve against Government, took the House
greatly by surprise, though we ourselves had reckoned on a
victory by three or four votes.&nbsp; About forty of the
Parnellites went with us.&nbsp; The excitement on the declaration
of the numbers was very great, and displayed itself rather
indecorously.&nbsp; Randolph Churchill jumped upon his seat and
stood waving his pocket-handkerchief and shouting; Walter left
the House with Algernon West, and said something about this being
a curious end of Gladstone&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; West said:
&ldquo;Oh, this won&rsquo;t be the end now; you will see him come
out more energetic than ever.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir Stafford
Northcote, it may be stated, seems at times to have been a good
deal bothered by Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; &lsquo;The most incredulous
man I ever met!&rsquo; he writes in his diary; &lsquo;keeps on
shaking his head whenever I refer to him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he
writes: &lsquo;Gladstone had been dining out to meet the
authoress of &ldquo;Sister Dora&rdquo;&mdash;Miss
Lonsdale&mdash;who was very much alarmed by the rapidity and
variety of his questions.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>we find him
complaining of Gladstone&rsquo;s habit of speaking late into the
dinner-hour, so that his opponent must either speak to empty
benches or forego the advantage of replying on the instant.&nbsp;
After this, we must admit Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s description of
himself on one occasion as an &lsquo;old Parliamentary
hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone Close at Hand&rsquo; is the title of Dr.
Parker&rsquo;s article of gossip about Mr. Gladstone in the
<i>New Review</i>.&nbsp; Once during his last Premiership Dr.
Parker had the honour of breakfasting with Mr. Gladstone in
Downing Street.&nbsp; After the meal Mr. Gladstone took down a
book and read aloud an account of the circumstances under which
Ireland was united to Great Britain.&nbsp; The account was so
pathetic that the reader broke down and sobbed like a
child.&nbsp; The ex-Premier permitted himself to be interviewed
by means of a written catechism Dr. Parker sent him, and the
answers are given in the article.&nbsp; Perhaps the way in which
some of the questions are ingeniously not answered is as
instructive as the direct replies to others.&nbsp; Asked whether,
in his opinion, the Church of England had a firmer hold upon the
people than ever it had, he said the Church suffered much from
the general decline of what is called the prestige of churches,
but had gained much from the transformation of the clergy.&nbsp;
He does not believe in the interchange of pulpits.&nbsp;
&lsquo;With all respect for those clergymen who are willing to
preach in Nonconformist pulpits, I must say,&rsquo; he replied,
&lsquo;they do not seem to form a proper conception of their own
Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Parker, not content with prose, broke out on one occasion
into song, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>&lsquo;An old Parliamentary Hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing an axe and raising a shield,<br />
Suspended the play with ominous words,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mine is the Bill that holds the
field.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Hatherley wrote in 1855: &lsquo;There is but one man of
genius in the House, I think&mdash;Gladstone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor Tyndall wrote in a letter to the <i>Times</i>:
&lsquo;Nature, which has so richly endowed him in many ways, has
denied him the faculty of discerning the defeat which, even in
the springtide of power and in the flush of victory, he has over
and over again gratuitously wooed.&nbsp; In fact, he thinks too
highly of himself and too meanly of his followers.&nbsp; Like
Napoleon&rsquo;s generals, they are to him mere mud, to be shaped
and moulded according to his imperial will.&nbsp; The
dissatisfaction arising from his conduct is not a thing of
yesterday.&nbsp; God, as Mahomed says, has made men to be
men&mdash;not foxes and wolves; and the love of truth and
abhorrence of untruth inherent in the healthy British character
have gradually opened the eyes of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s most able
and most independent supporters to his misdeeds.&nbsp; His errors
of judgment, his political dishonesty, his impulsiveness and
passion, so often invoked for purposes both ungenerous and
unwise, his tampering for party ends with the sustaining bulwarks
of the State, his cruel indifference to the fate of men far
nobler than himself who had trustfully accepted from him tasks
the faithful prosecution of which led them to a doom which he
might have averted, but did not avert, the voice of many a
brother&rsquo;s blood crying from the ground, had already shaken
the faith of honest Liberals in their idol, when his flagitious
Irish policy put an end to their forbearance and caused them to
fling abroad the banner of revolt.&nbsp; The <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>cream of
the Liberal party have been the seceders here; the men who above
all others adorned the Liberal ranks have been the first to
renounce the heresies of their recreant leader.&nbsp; A former
worshipper of the ex-Prime Minister said to me some time ago:
&ldquo;Never in the history of England was there such a consensus
of intellect arrayed against a statesman as that now arrayed
against Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; What a fall!&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; I
see with concern letters from Liberal Unionists in the
<i>Times</i> which seem to indicate that the writers only deem it
necessary for Mr. Gladstone to declare his abandonment of Home
Rule to make all right again with the Liberals.&nbsp; But who is
to guarantee Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s good faith in this
matter?&nbsp; He apostatized, for party purposes, when he became
a Home Ruler, and he will apostatize again whenever it suits his
ambition to do so.&nbsp; I should not be surprised if, some fine
day, he took those simple Unionists at their word and made the
required declaration.&nbsp; But could we be sure of him
afterwards?&nbsp; For years, according to his own confession, he
nourished in the dark corners of his mind this fungus of Home
Rule, while to all his friends he seemed earnestly bent on
extirpating it.&nbsp; A man of this stamp has no claim to the
trust or credence of Liberal Unionists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Writing in 1879, Principal Tulloch says: &lsquo;I bought the
<i>Observer</i> on my way back, and read Gladstone&rsquo;s
philippic against the Government.&nbsp; What a man he is!&nbsp;
What avenging and concentrated passion and power of hatred at the
age of seventy!&nbsp; If he gets back to power, he will certainly
play the devil with something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Talmage, who visited Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>a year or
two since, sailed from Liverpool on the following day on his
return to America.&nbsp; While in the Holy Land he secured a
large stone from Calvary, which is intended to form the
corner-stone of his proposed new church in Brooklyn.&nbsp; Dr.
Talmage, who was interviewed after his visit to Hawarden, said he
found Mr. Gladstone hale and hearty, and he ran up and down the
hills like a boy.&nbsp; The ex-Premier was sanguine that his Home
Rule scheme would succeed.&nbsp; Dr. Talmage asked if his faith
in Christianity had wavered in his old age.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone
answered: &lsquo;The longer I live, the stronger grows my faith
in God, and my only hope for the world is that the human race
will be brought more into contact with Divine
revelation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mozley writes in his &lsquo;Reminiscences&rsquo;:
&lsquo;As for Mr. Gladstone, I have for many years seldom thought
of him without being reminded of the terrible lines in which
Horace describes one of the attendants of that fickle goddess
whom he believed to be the arbiter of civil strife.&nbsp; Often
have I felt that I would rather grow cabbage, like Cincinnatus,
than be the public executioner of usurpations, monopolies, and
other abuses.&nbsp; But, after indulging in the sentiment, I have
swelled the triumph of justice, peace, and public good.&nbsp; I
have generally been so unfortunate in the use of my electoral
privileges that I have come to think them hardly worth the fuss
made about them; but the most unfortunate use I ever made of
them&mdash;so I felt at the time&mdash;was when I went up to
Oxford to vote for Mr. Gladstone, and he was actually
elected.&nbsp; It was some excuse for this ridiculous
inconsistency that I scarcely ever looked into Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>weekly organ&mdash;of course, he had not a weekly organ
in any other sense than he had a tail to his coat&mdash;without
seeing some very offensive and utterly untrue allusion to myself.
. . .&nbsp; But now, what is the singular good fortune or
providential protection I began with?&nbsp; Simply this: I never
in all my life once saw Mr. Gladstone, from the morning I met him
in Hurdis Lushington&rsquo;s room, three or four days after his
arrival from Eton, till he was so good as to ask me to breakfast
in June, 1882, and kindly suggest an alteration in my book.&nbsp;
On the former occasion he had all the purple bloom and freshness
of boyhood and the glow of generous emotion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Samuel Morley, M.P., wrote: &lsquo;I regard Mr. Gladstone
as the greatest, purest, and ablest statesman of the present age,
and of all ages or of any age.&nbsp; How great the sympathy
during his recent illness throughout the whole civilized
world!&nbsp; With what?&nbsp; Not with Mr. Gladstone as M.P. for
Midlothian; not with Gladstone as Premier or statesman; but
simply with Gladstone as the embodiment of the highest and purest
aspirations of that patriotism which desires the best of all good
things for the greatest number of our own fellow-countrymen, and
that the countrymen of all other countries may partake in these
good things also.&nbsp; His life, his health, his genius, his
power, and influence are of more consequence to the country than
all or any of the most pressing questions now before
Parliament.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No one, as was to be expected, has been more variously or
idiotically censured or blamed than Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp;
Considerable ingenuity has been displayed by more than one pious
clergyman to show that he is <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>the beast of Revelation.&nbsp; In
the opinion of one of them&mdash;the Rev. Canon Crosthwaite, of
Kildare&mdash;beheading is too good for Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; He
has &lsquo;bamboozled the House of Commons, and has persuaded it
to rob God and put His patrimony into the Treasury of
England.&nbsp; Essex lost his head for only talking to
O&rsquo;Neal across the river.&nbsp; What does not Mr. Gladstone
deserve,&rsquo; asks the Canon, in the <i>National Review</i>,
&lsquo;for trafficking with Irish rebels and betraying to them
all the rights of the British Crown?&nbsp; Yet this spoiler of
the Church is allowed to read lessons.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another
reverend, possibly a Dissenter, wrote to Mr. Gladstone to suggest
that he would add to the services he has rendered religion by
conducting a series of services in the Agricultural Hall.&nbsp;
In reply, declining the suggestion, Mr. Gladstone wrote:
&lsquo;It would expose me, with justice, to that charge of
ostentation which some think already attaches to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Actually a reverend gentleman compiled, under the head of
&lsquo;Musical Evenings with the Great and Good,&rsquo; a service
of song.&nbsp; The directions are to open with the hymn,
&lsquo;Hark, my soul! it is the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; A footnote
informs us that &lsquo;this hymn of Cowper&rsquo;s has been
translated by Mr. Gladstone into Italian.&rsquo;&nbsp; The direct
bearing of these facts is not at once apparent, but possibly
enlightenment may arrive during the &lsquo;Prayer&rsquo; which is
to follow.&nbsp; The first verse of the next hymn runs:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sing we a song of praise to-day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For battles fought and victories won,<br />
For strength vouchsafed upon our way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And noble work our cause has done;<br />
For joy that cometh after tears,<br />
And harvests reaped for fifty years.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>Later
on a kind of parenthetic observation runs, that &lsquo;Oxford is
an ancient seat of learning, and may be the fountain of
intellectual light; but it has ever been the home of political
darkness and the defender of exclusive privilege.&rsquo;&nbsp; As
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s earlier political career is very sweepingly
condemned, and the evil influences of the University deplored, it
is to be presumed that the half-century of harvest is a small
stretch of the exuberant poetic licence that Mr. Thoseby permits
himself occasionally.&nbsp; Personal encouragement to Mr.
Gladstone, however, is not wanting, and he is told to</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Hold on, my brother, hold on!<br />
Hold on till the prize is won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold on to the plough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weary not now,<br />
For the work is well-nigh done.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A subsequent song informs him positively that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The day shall appear,<br />
When the might with the right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Truth shall be:<br />
Come there what may to stand in the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That day the world shall see.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that there is to be</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;No
surrender, no surrender<br />
In the cause of truth and right.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But perhaps the climax of Gladstonolatry is reached in the
following passages:</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s work as legislator and
administrator there is, from first to last, the same thoroughness
and mastery.&nbsp; He never introduced a measure into the House
in a crude and incomplete manner.&nbsp; He mastered every detail,
and knew exactly the value and bearing of every suggestion and
amendment offered, and whether he could admit it or not.&nbsp; He
introduced <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>no measures merely to curry favour, to strengthen his
party, or catch the popular vote.&nbsp; He has always had regard
to pressing needs, and has made it a matter of duty to press and
pass the measures he introduced.&nbsp; And these measures have
never been condemned except by &ldquo;politicians in
distress.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his work as administrator he has not
left the work to be done by subordinates.&nbsp; He has attended
to his own duties, and toiled to understand every particular,
and, in consequence, he has never had to vacillate, taking a
position to-day from which he has had to withdraw to-morrow;
saying one thing to-day and contradicting it the next.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Remarkable as is the polished literary style of this citation,
it is surpassed in the following fantastic rhapsody:</p>
<p>&lsquo;His beautiful residence at Hawarden Castle, in
Cheshire, has much of the old baronial associations connected
with it.&nbsp; It is delightfully situated in a finely-wooded
park, where Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s well-known penchant for
tree-felling, as a relaxation, finds ample scope.&nbsp; And where
he also may gaze with joy on hill and dale, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Watch the wild birds soar and
sing,<br />
Or build their nest, or plume their wing.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And where, perchance, he may now and again sing to the
birds.&nbsp; Might not those birds, those beautiful birds,

<p>In 1870 Mr. Grant Duff, in the course of one of his <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>addresses
to his constituents, said that some years ago, when Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s Administration was in power, a clever Tory, who
hated both Mr. Gladstone and his Administration, wrote the
following acrostic:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;G was the great man, mountain of mind;<br
/>
L a logician, expert and refined;<br />
A was an adept in rhetoric&rsquo;s art,<br />
D was the dark spot he had in his heart;<br />
S was the sophistry led him astray;<br />
T was the truth that he bartered away;<br />
O was the cipher his conscience became;<br />
N the new light that enlightened the same;<br />
E was the evil one, shouting for joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;At it, and down with it,
Gladstone, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This acrostic was repeated in a drawing-room in the presence
of a young lady of good Liberal principles, and the daughter of a
well-known Member of Parliament, who, without leaving the room,
went to a table and wrote this answer to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;G is the genius that governs the nation;<br
/>
L are the Lords, who require education;<br />
A is the animus raised by the great;<br />
D are the donkeys who fear for the State:<br />
S is the standard that Liberals raise;<br />
T are the Tories who howl in dispraise;<br />
O &rsquo;s Opposition, wanting a head;<br />
N is the nation, not driven, but led;<br />
E is old England, shouting for joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stick to the Government,
Gladstone, my boy.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bitterness of some of the attacks on Mr. Gladstone were at
any rate a great testimony to his surpassing power and
popularity.&nbsp; In 1880 appeared a handbill under the title of
the &lsquo;Gladstonian Mess,&rsquo; announcing: &lsquo;A grand
banquet will be given at the Boar&rsquo;s Head Hotel immediately
after the sale of the effects of Mr. John Bull, previously
announced, carefully prepared by Mr. W. E. Gladstone, the
auctioneer, <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>and at the vendor&rsquo;s expense, to which all the
company are invited.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sale was
announced&mdash;Mr. Gladstone the auctioneer: &lsquo;The whole of
the vast landed estates, goods, chattels and effects of Mr. John
Bull, who is retiring from business on account of advancing age
and ill-health, induced by recent losses in the Transvaal
venture, comprising three kingdoms (united or otherwise), one
empire, one dominion, forty-eight colonies, and one Suzerainty,
one large public-house, known as the Lords and Commons, also an
extremely elegant, spacious, and well-built family residence,
known as the Buckingham Palace, with greenhouses, gardens,
stables, and every necessary appointment.&nbsp; The residence
contains ample accommodation for a family of position, is situate
in its own grounds, and commands good views of the Nelson
Monument, St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey, and
is within easy distance of the thriving market towns of London
and Westminster.&rsquo;&nbsp; As an indication, on the other
hand, of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s popularity, let me refer to the
Gladstone claret, which was supposed to be a peculiarly
economical and refreshing beverage, and the Gladstone
travelling-bag, which was described as a bag adapted for the
requirements of all travellers, of all ages, of both sexes and in
all grades of life.&nbsp; Someone took the trouble to issue the
prospectus of what was called the Gladstone Exploitation Company,
a further unintentional tribute.</p>
<p>The following appeared in a Turkish newspaper at the time of
the Bulgarian atrocities: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone is of Bulgarian
descent.&nbsp; His father was a pig-dealer in the villayet of
Kusteridje.&nbsp; Young Gladstone ran away at the age of sixteen
to Servia, and was then <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>with another pig-dealer sent to
London to sell pigs.&nbsp; He stole the proceeds, changed his
name from Troradin to Gladstone, and became a British
subject.&nbsp; Fortune favoured him till he became Prime
Minister.&nbsp; Gladstone has no virtues.&nbsp; Gold is his
god.&nbsp; The Ottoman Government offered him five thousand
pounds to put their finances in order, but subsequently withdrew
the offer, and his vexation at this, combined with his bad
Bulgarian nature, caused his opposition to the Turks.&nbsp; The
surname &ldquo;Gladstone&rdquo; means lust for gold, and was
given to him on account of his failings in that
respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Life of Lord Houghton&rsquo; we find another
illustrative anecdote.&nbsp; The writer says: &lsquo;One day, a
few years before his death, when he was dining at the house of
Mr. James Knowles, the conversation turned upon the relative
characteristics of Mr. Gladstone and Lord Beaconsfield, and it
was remarked by someone that if Lord Beaconsfield was a good
judge of men, Mr. Gladstone was a still better judge of
mankind.&nbsp; Houghton was asked to turn the epigram into verse,
and he did it as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We spake of two high names of speech and
pen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How each was seeing, and how each was blind;<br />
Knew not mankind, but keenly knew all men;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knew naught of men, but knew and loved
mankind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In connection with these great men it is interesting to note
that in 1867, when Parliament met, Mrs. Disraeli was lying
seriously ill.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, in the opening sentence of
his speech on the Address, gave public expression to the sympathy
of all parties.&nbsp; Lord Houghton, in referring to the fact,
adds: &lsquo;The scene in the House of Commons was very striking;
Dizzy quite unable to restrain his tears.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Lord
<a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>Beaconsfield died, however, many were found to censure
Mr. Gladstone for not having been present at the funeral of his
distinguished rival.</p>
<p>Lord Blachford&rsquo;s letters contain many short notices of
Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; In 1858 he gives a sketch of him in a
conference with Sir Edward Bulwer: &lsquo;It was very absurd to
see them talking it over; Gladstone&rsquo;s clear, dark eye and
serious face, and ponderous forehead and calm manner, was such a
contrast with Sir E.&rsquo;s lean and narrow face and humid,
theatrical, conscious kind of ways.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1868 he
writes to Newman: &lsquo;I have not yet got through
Gladstone&rsquo;s autobiography. . . .&nbsp; Of course, as you
say, some of his friends think it injudicious, and I am not sure
that it is not injudicious on that very account.&nbsp; One great
weight which Gladstone has to carry in the political race is a
character for want of judgment, and every addition to that is an
impediment.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1874, in July, when Mr. Gladstone
appeared in Parliament after four months&rsquo; absence to oppose
the Bill for the Abolition of Church Patronage in Scotland, Lord
Blachford writes: &lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;s opposition is
curious.&nbsp; I am sorry to say I cannot go with him on either
of his points&mdash;indeed, I may almost say on any.&nbsp; I see
no reason why the Scotch Church should not have their way about
patronage.&nbsp; I think the cry against the Public Worship Bill
a scare, and I particularly object to the principle and working
of the Endowed Schools Act.&nbsp; However, everybody seems to
agree that he made a great speech on the Public Worship Bill as a
matter of oratory.&nbsp; He does not seem to care much about what
was his party, who, I suppose, are dead against him on two out of
three of these points.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>Of
Mr. Gladstone, John Arthur Roebuck, a bellicose
Radical&mdash;very noisy in his time&mdash;says: &lsquo;He may be
a very good chopper, but, depend upon it, he is not an English
statesman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of Tennyson, it is said that he loved Mr.
Gladstone, but detested his policy.</p>
<p>The late Sir James Stansfeld is reported as saying to an
interviewer: &lsquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s conduct in the Cabinet
was very curious.&nbsp; When I first joined in 1871, I naturally
expected that his position was so commanding that he would be
able to say, &ldquo;This is my policy; accept it or not, as you
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Sir James Graham was examined before a
committee on Admiralty administration, he was asked: &ldquo;What
would happen if a member of your Board did not agree with your
policy?&rdquo;&nbsp; He answered: &ldquo;He would cease to be a
member of my board.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought Mr. Gladstone would
have taken the same line, but he did not.&nbsp; He was always
profuse in his expressions of respect for his Cabinet.&nbsp;
There is a wonderful combination in Mr. Gladstone of
imperiousness and deference; in the Cabinet he would assume that
he was nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> appeared a curious estimate
of Mr. Gladstone by an Indian gentleman.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
has,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;a natural prejudice, almost
antipathy, to the name of Turk.&nbsp; His mind, in some respects,
resembles that of some pious, learned, but narrow-minded priest
of the middle ages; and his unreasoning prejudice against the
Turk is indeed medi&aelig;val, and worthy of those dark ages of
blood, belief and Quixotic chivalry.&nbsp; A person of such
character, however graphic and sublime he may be, should not have
such a great political influence on the minds of millions of his
fellow-beings; he should not be at the head of a vast <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>empire such
as that of England of to-day if he cannot constrain his emotions
and his ecclesiastical prejudices.&nbsp; He is a sublime moral
leader of men; but a statesman of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s position
should be more calm, more deliberate, and should weigh his words
carefully before he speaks.&nbsp; He should take care that his
writings and speeches do not wound the feelings of millions of
his fellow-subjects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the defeat of the Liberal party in 1895, the <i>National
Review</i> wrote: &lsquo;One can now appreciate the previously
provoking description of Mr. Gladstone as a great Conservative
force.&nbsp; His Irish escapade has shattered the Liberal party,
made the House of Lords invulnerable, and the Church
unassailable.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Guinness Rogers wrote that Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s retirement was one of the causes of the defeat
of the Liberal party.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is to a large extent a
measure of the enormous influence of that commanding
personality.&nbsp; Not until the secret history of that period
can be studied will it be known how tremendous was the loss which
the Liberal party sustained by the withdrawal from the strife of
a leader who towered head and shoulders over all his
associates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone seems seldom to have made a speech but his
friends favoured him with their criticisms.&nbsp; Thus, when in
1871 he visited Yorkshire and made speeches at Wakefield and
Whitby, Lord Houghton wrote, after praising one of his speeches:
&lsquo;I cannot say as much for your Whitby speech, for it
confirmed my feelings that on the high mountain where you stand
there is a demon, not of demagogism, but of demophilism, that is
tempting you sorely.&nbsp; I am no alarmist, but it is undeniable
that a new and thoroughly <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>false conception of the relations of
work and wealth is invading society, and of which the Paris
Commune is the last expression.&nbsp; Therefore one word from
such a man as you, implying that you look on individual wealth as
anything else than a reserve of public wealth, and that there can
be any antagonism between them, seems to me infinitely
dangerous.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone replied, writes Lord
Houghton&rsquo;s biographer, with his usual frankness and
friendliness to the remonstrances of his old friend, &lsquo;whose
criticisms are marked by the kindly tone which is habitual with
you, though I do not agree with everything you say about
property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Francis Doyle will have it that to Mr. Disraeli is due the
fact that Mr. Gladstone left the Conservatives.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
may all of us recollect,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;the Irish
soldiers who marched up to and then passed a standard erected by
William III.&nbsp; Some regiments moved to the right and others
to the left, the right-hand division taking service under Louis
XIV., the other division submitting to the English
Government.&nbsp; On their first separation they were but an inch
or two apart, but the distance gradually widened between them
till they or their representatives met face to face at
Fontenoy.&nbsp; So, after Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s death, Lord
Beaconsfield&rsquo;s presence established like that standard a
line of demarcation between the two portions of the Tory
party.&nbsp; Had it not been for the line fixed across their
path, I think Mr. Gladstone, Herbert, and the other Peelites
would have joined Lord Derby instead of the Whigs.&nbsp; Nor
would Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s logic have been in fault (when is
it?), or failed to justify abundantly the course he had
taken.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AT HOME.</span></h2>
<p>Hawarden Park, in the centre of which stands Hawarden Castle,
is one of the finest country seats in the three kingdoms.&nbsp;
Visitors who arrive at Hawarden for the first time are surprised
at the extent of the grounds and the beauty of the park.&nbsp;
Hawarden Park, with Hawarden Castle, came to Mr. Gladstone with
his wife.&nbsp; When Mr. Gladstone married he had no intention of
making his seat in Wales, but finding that Sir Stephen Glynne was
in circumstances which rendered it disadvantageous to the family
for him to live in the Castle, Mr. Gladstone bought some of the
land, and took up his quarters with his father-in-law in the
Castle, which had been temporarily closed.&nbsp; This arrangement
lasted for many years, and was attended with none of the
disagreeable consequences which so often happen when two
generations live under one roof.&nbsp; The two families lived
side by side, and nothing could exceed the harmony of the united
households.&nbsp; Sir Stephen Glynne always sat at the head of
the table, while Mrs. Gladstone sat at the other end; Mr.
Gladstone sat between.&nbsp; This arrangement continued down to
the death of Sir Stephen <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>Glynne, and it was rather curious to
see a statesman whose name and whose fame were familiar
throughout the world always taking the second place in his own
house.&nbsp; But for the somewhat embarrassed circumstances of
Sir Stephen Glynne, which led Mr. Gladstone to buy some of the
Glynne estate, it was his intention to have bought a seat in
Scotland, to which, as his native country, Mr. Gladstone was
always strongly attached.&nbsp; The accident, therefore, of a
temporary financial embarrassment on the part of his
father-in-law made Hawarden famous throughout the world, and
supplied Mr. Gladstone with a very much more convenient country
seat than any which he could have procured north of the
Tweed.</p>
<p>The Castle is situated on the summit of a range of hills
overlooking Chester and the river Dee.&nbsp; The village contains
the remains of a castle which dates back almost to the Conqueror,
and the ancient mound fortification, the ditch and drawbridge,
and the keep, are proof to-day of its power in the past.&nbsp;
The old Castle standing in the grounds is scarce more than a
relic now.&nbsp; The modern Castle in which the Gladstone family
resides was built over a hundred years ago, and has been
considerably added to from time to time, so that it is a
comparatively new seat.&nbsp; It has a splendid appearance; the
stone battlements and walls, which are well grown with ivy, look
especially striking.&nbsp; The grounds contain several points of
interest, and are exceedingly well wooded, <i>even now</i>, much
to the surprise of many visitors, who have heard no little of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s powers with his axe.</p>
<p>The new buildings of the Library, which stand not far from the
church, have a neat entrance-gate <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>leading to them, with a well-kept
lawn on each side.&nbsp; It is in no sense a public institution,
but is intended to afford to clergymen and others an opportunity
of quiet study.&nbsp; Here are gathered thousands of volumes,
carefully selected, representing an eclectic field of thought,
including the whole area of human interest.&nbsp; By the side of
an erudite Churchman like Pusey you will discover a book by a
Nonconformist like Dale.&nbsp; The volumes were in many cases
brought to the library by Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s own hands, and on
many an afternoon he was to be seen walking through the park with
a bundle of books, to be arranged on the shelves by his own hands
or under his superintendence.&nbsp; Not far off in the village
street stands the substantial building called the Hawarden
Institute.&nbsp; Upstairs in the library are to be seen volumes
with characteristic inscriptions by Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; On the
flyleaf of one of the Waverley Novels is written, for instance:
&lsquo;No library should be complete without a set of Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s novels in full.&nbsp; Accordingly, I present this
set to the Hawarden Institute.&rsquo;&nbsp; Attached to the
institute is a capital billiard-room, a bath-room, and a
reading-room.&nbsp; The gymnasium, which was given by Mr. Herbert
Gladstone, is not patronized quite so much as that gentleman, it
is understood, desires.</p>
<p>The library at Hawarden is one of the finest private libraries
in the country.&nbsp; It consists of more than twenty thousand
volumes, and considerable curiosity existed as to what Mr.
Gladstone intended to do with this collection of books after his
death.&nbsp; Contrary to the usual practice obtaining in
magnificent private libraries, Mr. Gladstone allowed his books to
be lent out to <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>almost anyone in the neighbourhood who wished to read
them.&nbsp; At one time this liberty was unlimited; anyone could
take a book out and keep it an indefinite period, provided that
he simply left an acknowledgment of having borrowed the
book.&nbsp; This privilege, however, was so much abused by some
persons that a few years ago a rule was laid down limiting the
time for which a book might be kept to one month.&nbsp; With that
exception, however, the Hawarden Library is still the free loan
library of the countryside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Within, Hawarden Castle,&rsquo; says a writer in the
<i>World</i>, &lsquo;though not ambitiously large, contains more
than one roomy cell for its scholar-recluse.&nbsp; At every
corner the signs of taste and culture abound.&nbsp; The pictures
have been only slightly thinned by the handsome contribution to
the Wrexham Exhibition, and curious china is not entirely
absent.&nbsp; Oriental jars and costly cabinets of Japanese
lacquer are scattered about the handsome rooms with tasteful
carelessness, and here and there are specimens of art needlework,
in the revival of which Mrs. Gladstone is known to take great
interest.&nbsp; But the peculiarity of the house is the vast
flood of books, which no one apartment can contain.&nbsp; Out of
one library into another, and into drawing-room and dining-room,
books have flowed in a resistless stream, pushing other things
aside, and establishing themselves in their place.&nbsp; There
are books new and old, rare and common, choice editions and
ordinary manuals of reference, ponderous tomes of controversial
theology and snappish little pamphlets on the currency, with
other equally light and pleasant subjects.&nbsp; Over all reigns
that air of easy and natural luxury which forms the principal
charm of the English <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>country-house proper, as
distinguished from the comfortless vastness of foreign
<i>ch&acirc;teaux</i> and the pretentious splendour of the
suburban villa of the <i>nouveau riche</i>.&nbsp; The castellan,
however, is no admirer of nooks and snuggeries, loving most to
get through his morning reading in an especially large apartment,
garnished with movable bookshelves&mdash;a transparent hive for a
working bee&mdash;amid abundant air and floods of sunshine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Air and light,&rdquo; and plenty of them, are among his
prime conditions of existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s study,&rsquo; says another
visitor, &lsquo;is rather curiously arranged.&nbsp; The walls are
covered with books, and volumes are also massed on large shelves
jutting out from the walls into the room.&nbsp; Between each
partition of books there is room to walk; thus the saving of
space in arranging the library in this manner is enormous.&nbsp;
The stock of books perhaps exceeds fifteen thousand volumes, and
notwithstanding this large number, Mr. Gladstone has little
difficulty in placing his hand upon any volume that he may
require.&nbsp; There are three writing-desks in the room; one is
chiefly reserved for correspondence of a political nature and
another is used by Mrs. Gladstone.&nbsp; Looking out of the study
window, the flower-beds facing the Castle present a picturesque
appearance, while the heavy-wooded grounds beyond stand out in
bold relief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The village itself is only one street, and a small one; but no
village has become more famous and has been more visited by
savants, politicians, famous individuals, foreign or English, and
deputations consisting of working men, either to watch the great
statesman felling trees or to hear him talk.</p>
<p>In a magazine known as the <i>Young Man</i> appeared a <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>few years
since an interesting account of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s home life,
which may claim to be quoted here.&nbsp; The writer, who was one
of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s nearest neighbours and most intimate
friends, said that there was no home in the United Kingdom where
there was more freedom of opinion or more frankness in expressing
disagreement than in the home of Mr. Gladstone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His daily life at home is a model of simplicity and
regularity, and the great secret of the vast amount of work he
accomplishes lies in the fact that every odd five minutes is
occupied.&nbsp; No man ever had a deeper sense of the
preciousness of time and the responsibility which everyone incurs
by the use or misuse he makes of it.&nbsp; To such a length does
he carry this that at a picnic to a favourite Welsh mountain he
has been seen to fling himself on the heather, and bury himself
in some pamphlet upon a question of the day, until called to
lighter things by those who were responsible for the provision
basket.&nbsp; His grand maxim is <i>never to be doing
nothing</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Although Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s daily routine is
familiar to some, yet many inaccurate accounts have been
circulated from time to time.&nbsp; In bed about twelve, he
sleeps like a child until called in the morning.&nbsp; Not a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation does he allow himself, although, as we
have heard him say, no schoolboy could long more desperately for
an extra five minutes.&nbsp; He is down by eight o&rsquo;clock,
and at church (three-quarters of a mile off) every morning for
the 8.30 service.&nbsp; No snow or rain, no tempest, however
severe, has ever been known to stop him.&nbsp; Directly after
breakfast a selection of his letters is brought to him.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&lsquo;Excepting before breakfast, Mr. Gladstone does
not go out in the morning.&nbsp; At 2 p.m.,&rsquo; continues the
<i>Young Man</i>, &lsquo;he comes to luncheon, and at the present
time he usually spends the afternoon arranging the books at his
new library.&nbsp; To this spot he has already transported nearly
twenty thousand books, and every volume he puts into its place
with his own hand.&nbsp; To him books are almost as sacred as
human beings, and the increase of their numbers is perhaps as
interesting a problem as the increase of population.&nbsp; It is
real pain to him to see a book badly treated&mdash;dropped on the
floor, unduly squeezed into the bookcase, dog&rsquo;s-eared, or,
worst crime of all, laid open upon its face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A short drive or walk before the social cup of tea
enables him to devote the remaining hour or so before post-time
to completing his correspondence.&nbsp; After dinner he returns
to his sanctum&mdash;a very temple of peace in the evening, with
its bright fire, armchair, warm curtains, and shaded reflecting
candle.&nbsp; Here, with an occasional doze, he reads until
bedtime, and thus ends a busy, fruitful day.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone
has often been heard to remark that had it not been for his
Sunday rest, he would not now be the man he is.&nbsp; Physically,
intellectually, and spiritually, his Sunday has been to him a
priceless blessing.&nbsp; From Saturday night to Monday morning
Mr. Gladstone puts away all business of a secular nature, keeps
to his special Sunday books and occupations, and never dines out
that day unless to cheer a sick or sorrowful friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hawarden Castle was much improved after passing into Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; In commemoration of the golden
wedding the porch in front of the Castle was erected, a building
that adds much to its appearance.&nbsp; <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>A writer in
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i> says: &lsquo;A glance over the
tables in the drawing-room at Hawarden Castle leads one to the
conviction that Mr. Gladstone is the most photographed man in the
world.&nbsp; The tables are literally covered with photographs
presenting the well-known face and figure in all habitual
circumstances and attitudes.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone submits to the
photographer much upon the same principle that he endures many
other of the experiences that sadden life.&nbsp; He recognises a
certain amount of possession that the public have in him, and if
they insist upon taking it out in photography, that is their
affair.&nbsp; He is not only photographed often, but happily,
having, indeed, by this time acquired so much skill that he
always comes out well.&nbsp; But,&rsquo; continues the writer,
&lsquo;no photograph, or the fine oil painting of Millais, comes
up to the interest possessed by a little ivory painting which
lies in the drawing-room at Hawarden.&nbsp; It represents a
little boy some two years of age sitting on the knee of a little
girl in nymph-like costume, and fondly supposed to be learning
his letters.&nbsp; He has, in truth, one chubby little finger
pointed towards the book which rests on his sister&rsquo;s knees,
but his face is raised, and two great brown eyes look inquiringly
into those of the beholder.&nbsp; This is the child&mdash;the
father of the man who sits in the other room, though beyond the
measurement of the floor there stretches between them the long
span of seventy years.&nbsp; The little girl is Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s sister, who died.&nbsp; The portrait was taken
in Liverpool, while Mr. John Gladstone lived in Rodney
Street.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone has recently disposed of the question of
his hobbies.&nbsp; He has none.&nbsp; Before the day of his <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>retirement
into private life, however, the public took a partially
proprietary interest in what they were pleased to consider his
hobby of cutting down trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It became so notorious that foreigners got to suppose
that Mr. Gladstone did little else in his spare time but fell
timber, and Americans who visited Hawarden Castle were
disappointed at not finding the park a desolation of
tree-stumps.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Mr. Gladstone should often have gone out, axe in
hand, to assist his woodmen was really the most natural thing
imaginable.&nbsp; Wood-cutting was just the kind of Titanic
exercise in which he delighted to let out the flood of his
energy.&nbsp; Again, the park being one of the best timbered in
England, it was to be expected that Mr. Gladstone, with a keen
eye to the improvement of the property, should take a personal
interest in the removal of those trees whose growth, position or
decay marred the splendour of their neighbours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone is now a very old man&mdash;older than
many who remember him in his vigorous Parliamentary days quite
realize.&nbsp; It is many years since his wood-cutting
exploits.&nbsp; But, three summers ago, on a special occasion, he
went out for the last time on his favourite pastime.&nbsp; The
axe that he used&mdash;a new one, and lighter than those he
usually wielded&mdash;is now stored away in a cupboard in Mr.
Herbert Gladstone&rsquo;s room at the Castle.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the
end of the handle,&rdquo; says a writer in <i>Pearson&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> for March, &ldquo;is pasted a little label with the
brief inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Used by W. E. G. on a beech in the
North Garden, 1895.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s favourite implement was the
ordinary <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>wedge-shaped American axe.&nbsp; But one that he used a
great deal in later days still stands in a corner of his
study.&nbsp; Its long, thin blade made it a difficult weapon to
handle skilfully; yet the shape or size of the axe made little
difference to so experienced a craftsman.&nbsp; In an outdoor
room at Hawarden, now chiefly devoted to the storage of bicycles
and fishing-baskets, are between thirty and forty axes piled
together&mdash;long axes and short axes, thick and thin, plain
and varnished, new and worn.&nbsp; These represent only a small
portion of the collection that Mr. Gladstone once had.&nbsp; In
bygone days admirers were constantly sending him axes as marks of
their esteem, and now other admirers quite as constantly smuggle
them away as treasured mementoes of their visits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides these workaday axes one may see several with
silver heads, and among them one, especially valued, that was
presented to Mr. Gladstone in 1884 by the workmen on the Forth
Bridge.&nbsp; There are, too, miniature axes beautifully modelled
in solid gold, kept among the jewels in the drawing-room; and a
silver pencil, axe-shaped, which was presented to the G. O. M. by
the Princess of Wales &ldquo;for axing
questions.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1870 Hayward writes: &lsquo;I had an immensity of talk on
all subjects with Gladstone.&nbsp; I strolled about with him for
some hours yesterday.&nbsp; He takes whatever work he has to do
easily enough here, and finds time for general reading into the
bargain.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1871 the same writer says:
&lsquo;Gladstone as he always is as a
companion&mdash;conversation singularly rich and
varied.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such seems to have been the common testimony
of all who had the honour of spending a brief time with Mr.
Gladstone at home.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>It is
idle, and would be tiresome, to give the history of the
deputations of working-men who went to Hawarden.&nbsp; As an
illustration, let me say that one December day a number of the
working-men of Derby went to Hawarden to present Mr. Gladstone
with a dessert-service of Derby china, specially manufactured at
the Derby Crown Works for the occasion.&nbsp; When in 1882 Mr.
Gladstone celebrated his political jubilee, addresses and
telegrams came to him at Hawarden from all parts of the
country.&nbsp; When in 1877 Hawarden was invaded by fourteen
hundred members of the Bolton Liberal Club, he refused to see
them, but quietly informed them that he and his son were about to
fell a tree in the course of the day in the park, and thither the
crowd repaired, where, after Mr. Gladstone had performed his
task, he gave them an address.&nbsp; One of his great
wood-cutting feats that year was his felling an enormous
beech-tree&mdash;a task he performed in three hours.&nbsp; It was
a tough job, considering that it measured thirteen feet in
circumference, and was a good proof of the aged statesman&rsquo;s
muscular strength and activity.&nbsp; Hercules alone seems to
have been his equal.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most enormous deputations ever received at
Hawarden was in 1886, when the Irish deputations came over in
great strength to Hawarden, one of them bearing an address signed
by 600,000 Irish women.&nbsp; The others brought to him the
freedoms of Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Clonmel.&nbsp; In
acknowledging the addresses received, Mr. Gladstone dwelt upon
the moderation with which the Home Rule agitation was carried
on.&nbsp; He declared that it would ultimately succeed, and
denied that the Irish demand involved <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>separation.&nbsp; Yet at one time
there were fears for Hawarden and Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; In 1882
Lord Houghton, while staying there, wrote to his son:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Robert</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be easy about my personal security.&nbsp; We
have two detectives&mdash;one engaged to the cook; and Lord
Spencer brought three more yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the Hawarden Post-office a volume might be written.&nbsp;
There could scarcely have been one more filled with important
correspondence in all the empire.&nbsp; Everyone deemed it to be
his duty to pester Mr. Gladstone with letters, and his replies in
the shape of postcards were to be found carefully preserved
everywhere.&nbsp; Even illness severe and protracted was no
excuse.&nbsp; &lsquo;One of the most painful incidents connected
with Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s illness,&rsquo; writes the London
correspondent of the <i>Birmingham Daily Post</i>, &lsquo;is the
persistence of uninvited spiritual advisers in addressing
him.&nbsp; I am told that not a day, and scarcely a post, passes
without some of these personages intruding themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chapters from the Old and New Testaments, the lives of
Scriptural personages, isolated texts, hymns and religious
books&mdash;in some cases the advice coming from the unknown
authors themselves&mdash;have all been suggested for the veteran
statesman&rsquo;s &ldquo;edification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In not a few instances poems on the same theme have
been sent for his perusal, and, as the authors have generally put
it, for his spiritual comfort and relief.&nbsp; I need hardly say
that these effusions have never reached Mr. Gladstone, but they
have in not a few instances, by their very suggestiveness of
impending disaster, caused distress to his family.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>A
representative of the <i>Daily Mail</i> added more on this
subject: &lsquo;Among people in touch with the Hawarden household
it is being discussed with a good deal of indignant comment, and
more than one well-known name is mentioned as having been
appended to some of this correspondence.&nbsp; It is not so much
the gratuitous impertinence of the amateur spiritual consoler
which occasions the annoyance Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s relatives
feel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone has throughout his life loomed so large
in the eyes of the religious public that he has always been a
favourite target for the controversialists of every sect.&nbsp;
He long ago grew accustomed to being bombarded with controversial
pamphlets, and to being assailed with texts of Scripture bearing
more or less obliquely upon some political question of the
day.&nbsp; And whenever he has been suffering from some trifling
indisposition, or has sustained any family loss or affliction,
sackfuls of letters quoting texts of Scripture have been sent to
him.&nbsp; It occasions neither surprise nor any great amount of
annoyance, therefore, now that the sympathy of everyone is turned
towards him, that in the case of fervid religionists it should
find expression in passages of Scripture and extracts from
devotional works from which the senders have themselves, in times
of sorrow and affliction, derived comfort and consolation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there are other classes of correspondents.&nbsp;
There are people who urge him for his soul&rsquo;s sake to see
the error of his ways while there is yet time; there are people
who see occasion in his present illness to hasten to say that
they forgive him for holding theological views differing from
their own; there are people who <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>invite him to send a subscription to
something with a view to insuring to himself posthumous
satisfaction, as well as the advantage of grateful prayer and
intercession.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, worst of all, and most painful to the relatives to
bear, are the frantic efforts of the testimonial hunters in a
hurry.&nbsp; One patent medicine has made strenuous endeavours to
foist itself upon him, with an obvious view to subsequent
advertisement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, there is another side to the picture.&nbsp;
The kindly and sympathetic messages and inquiries which have come
from people of all ranks, from her Majesty the Queen downwards,
have been of great comfort.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I conclude this rapid survey with a quotation from Mr. G. W.
E. Russell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gladstone&rsquo;: &lsquo;In order to
form the highest and truest estimate of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
character, it is necessary to see him at home.&nbsp; But to do
this is a privilege accorded necessarily to the few.&nbsp; The
public can only judge him by his public life; and from this point
of view it may be that the judgment of one of his colleagues may
be accepted when he said: &ldquo;The only two things Mr.
Gladstone really cares for are the Church and
finance.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; What may be the verdict of history
on him as a statesman it is impossible to foretell.&nbsp; In
England, at any rate, no man has been a power so long.&nbsp; To
most of us, to borrow from Shakespeare, he seems to bestride this
narrow world like a Colossus.&nbsp; He has done much to help the
advent of the new democracy, but it is as a commercial reformer,
apparently, that Mr. Gladstone will be best known to future
ages.&nbsp; In that capacity he produced marvellous
changes.&nbsp; By making paper <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>cheap he gave an impulse to the
publishing trade, of which we have not yet seen the end.&nbsp; By
the Methuen Treaty it was deemed a heavy blow was struck at
Portugal.&nbsp; Under Mr. Gladstone, with the aid of Richard
Cobden, that treaty was got rid of, the light wines of France
were introduced, the social habits of the country were changed
for the better, and the commerce of the country largely
increased.&nbsp; The anomalies of the navigation laws were
perhaps more marvellous than those of the commercial
treaties.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone had much to do with removing those
anomalies, and the result was a marvellous increase in the growth
of British shipping and foreign commerce, and the revenue
increased, as Mr. Gladstone stated, by leaps and bounds; and
while the working man has secured better wages, his power of
purchase has been largely increased.&nbsp; Alas! poverty,
selfishness, ignorance are still at work in our midst, and Utopia
seems as far off as ever.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On May 19 the end came, and all over the world, to the grief
of the nation, it was known that Mr. Gladstone was no more.</p>
<p>Parliament unanimously voted him a Public Funeral in
Westminster Abbey, where he was laid to rest May 28, 1898.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
